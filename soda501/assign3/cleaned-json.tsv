Britain freed itself from its 47-year membership in the E.U. Very satisfying moment. Sorry, Angela Merkel. She remarked, this is a deep cut for us all. Happy Brexit. Enjoy your freedom, Britain.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">We'll see you on Monday back at...</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT, I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">We begin with the Fox News alert. An end to the impeachment trial is in sight, no more witnesses, no more evidence. Both sides will present closing arguments starting Monday at 11:00 a.m. with the final vote on the two articles against the president expected on Wednesday.</p><p>Senator Mike Lee is here live with reaction to tonight's late-night votes. In the meantime, all eyes now turn to Iowa, the first in the nation caucus where a win will have major implications for the Democrats hoping to faceoff with President Trump. FOX NEWS @ NIGHT will be there live from Des Moines with results as they roll in throughout the night.</p><p>What about the democratic senators who were trapped in the impeachment trial here, instead of hitting the trail, we will debate the impact on their campaigns.</p><p>But now, we want to head over to Capitol Hill. Correspondent Chad Pergram is standing by. OK. Chad, it looks like we finally get to this vote on whether or not to acquit on Wednesday. So why the delay and what will the weight of that moment be like?</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER: Yes. This is going to be a moment of history, as they move 4:00 in the afternoon on Wednesday to vote on the verdicts here on these articles of impeachment, two separate votes on both articles of impeachment, abuse of power, and obstruction of Congress. It needs two-thirds, 67 votes to convict and remove. Nobody thinks that they're anywhere close to that.</p><p>Here's what happens. The senators actually vote from their desk. They called her names alphabetically, they rise, and according to the Senate impeachment rules, they're supposed to declare guilty or not guilty.</p><p>Now in 1999, the late senator from Pennsylvania, Arlen Specter, he said not proved, therefore, not guilty. They said, no, you can't do that. But we will see how this vote will go on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>I would start to look at some potential crossover vote. On the Democratic side of the aisle, I would look at Kyrsten Sinema. She is a moderate Democrat from Arizona. Joe Manchin from West Virginia. You might remember that President Trump carried his state by 42 points. And Doug Jones, the Democrat from Alabama who has a very competitive reelection this fall.</p><p>On the Republican side certainly look at Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney and Susan Collins of Maine. Susan Collins of course is facing a tough reelect as well.</p><p>BREAM: All right, Chad. So what is it going to be like having the state of the union now? It's going to have to go off in the middle of this with that vote still not taken.</p><p>PERGRAM: Yes. That's right. You know, and this has happened before back in 1999 with President Clinton's impeachment trial, same thing happened, January 19th, 1999. Democrats kind of thought that this might be a good way, what's good for the goose, good for the gander. If President Clinton had to go through it, so should President Trump. It will be a little bit awkward.</p><p>And that said it, you know, some Republicans were upset that they weren't able to get an agreement to finish this impeachment trial tonight or over the weekend. And this is a couple of comments from some Republican sources I spoke with. ""It's the best deal Mitch McConnell could get. Finally, it'll be over. It's a terrible thing. Republican senators should have stayed in on Saturday. They got rolled.""</p><p>Now, the White House director of legislative affairs, Eric Ueland, he's putting a very different spin on this, indicating that it's to the advantage of the president to have state of the union one night and then go to the verdict on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>And Ueland says it's a strong one-two punch, both help bring the focus the present successes, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, Chad. So there had been a question. We had talked about many times during the trial, if it got to a tie, would the chief justice have to weigh in? So he finally clarified this today, and it's important to president in the Senate.</p><p>PERGRAM: That's right. We have an answer to this. You know, in 1868, the chief justice, Salmon P. Chase, presiding over the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson. He voted twice on three tie votes.</p><p>And a lot of people said, you know, could you do this? Technically, the vice president is supposed to be able to break the tie, but that's not the case in the Senate impeachment trial. Listen to what John Roberts said from the day is tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it would be inappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government to assert the power to change that result so that the motion would succeed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERGRAM: You know, the Senate works a lot on precedent. There's a book of precedents. That's something that they turn to every day. And with this ruling by John Roberts, they have a new president and if there's another Senate trial at some point involving the impeachment of a president, we know the answer. Can the chief justice vote or not? He can't. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: All right. Chad Pergram, another historic day. Get some rest. Back at it on Monday.</p><p>PERGRAM: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: Thanks, Chad.</p><p>OK. We're told the president was calm tonight, pleased that the impeachment trial will wrap up with no more witnesses or evidence. Now the commander in chief is turning his attention to Tuesday State of the Union address.</p><p>White House correspondent Kevin Corke is following the latest reaction. Good evening, Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Evening, Shannon.</p><p>White House sources telling Fox News to expect the president to strike an incredibly optimistic tone. In his final State of the Union Address before the 2020 election, they say expect a heavy emphasis on America's economic successes, an incredibly bright future led, of course, by the 45th president of the United States.</p><p>They are saying this speech will be positive and unifying. That's what aides are telling us, describing the upcoming remarks, Tuesday's address of the nation meant to shine a spotlight, they've tell us on his administration's recent successes with particular emphasis, Shannon, on the blue-collar boom, supporting working families, lowering the cost of health care, safe and legal immigration system, and protecting national security.</p><p>But with the cloud of impeachment still hovering overhead, it is less clear what if anything the president might say about the Democrat-led impeachment which, as you just heard Chad point out, will be dismissed by an acquittal very likely in the Senate on Wednesday.</p><p>And while White House officials were measured in their reaction to the Senate's vote today on more witnesses, the president was still fired up. Let me take it to Twitter. He said this, ""No matter what you give the Democrats, in the end, it will never be satisfied."" He went on to add, ""In the House, they gave us nothing.""</p><p>Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo today vowed that the Trump administration would not waver in its support for Ukraine despite hands of a bit of political strain in the alliance and the impeachment saga all began.</p><p>Everything should be wrapped up we're told by Wednesday. You heard Chad allude to that, and they can't come soon enough say White House officials. Shannon, back to you.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Kevin Corke on a rainy night down there at the Southern White House. Thank you, Kevin.</p><p>So three major breaking news events happening over the course of the next few days. The Iowa caucuses, President Trump's State of the Union Address and then we think that final trial impeachment vote on Wednesday.</p><p>Joining us now to talk about that, Republican senator from Utah, Mike Lee also sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Good to have you with us.</p><p>SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: Listen, both sides sound a little dissatisfied tonight. I'm hearing from Democrats who say, you know, this whole thing has been a sham, we never got any of the evidence and witnesses that we thought we needed to complete this. On the other side, a lot of people on the right are asking me, what the heck happened, why wasn't this resolved before the State of the Union? What went down on that?</p><p>LEE: Look, we all wish that it could have been, and perhaps, it should have been. We were told but we couldn't get it done between now and then. In the meantime, this is a victory. It's a huge victory that we got this evidentiary issue behind us.</p><p>Now, look, I know the Democrats have been presenting all this kabuki theater, claiming that we need to have new witnesses. Look, we've heard testimony from 13 witnesses. We've reviewed hundreds of pages of briefing, thousands of pages of evidence. We' have had the proceedings that we need to have. We've satisfied our duty as the trial court of impeachment.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Well, I want to give you a chance to respond to one of your colleagues who does not clearly feel the same way. Democrat, Senator Liz Warren who is also running for the presidency tweets this. ""Senate Republicans just failed the American people and broke their oath to the United States constitution.""</p><p>We have talked about how much you love the constitution. Tonight, she says you trashed it.</p><p>LEE: She couldn't be more mistaken. Look, it is very important to honor the rights of the accused, as she knows of all people. A former law professor. She should respect the fact that we're looking out for the rights of the accused here. Donald Trump was incorrectly accused of a lot of things and we honored his procedural rights in a way that the House of Representatives always refused to do.</p><p>Tonight, we made good on that promise to do right by him, to do impartial justice. And we concluded appropriately that we don't need to have any more witnesses. After all the witnesses and all the evidence that we've received, there's no more need to do that.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Here's what Senator Blumenthal has to say about what the trial really means.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): I was so deeply disappointed and dismayed, there's no vindication here, no victory for the president. And there is a court of appeals which is the court of public opinion. We have to take our case to the voters in November.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: OK. So a couple of things there. First of all, you know the left is saying there's always going to be an asterisk on this. It wasn't a real trial. There wasn't a full vetting of the claims.</p><p>And secondly, how worried are you about the fact that these -- you know, there are going to be campaign ads made out of this. They're going to use this to run against you guys this fall?</p><p>LEE: Yes, they are and they're going to lose. This is going to backfire. I think the American people see what we see, which is the American people, especially America's hard working poor middle-class Americans are doing much better under the Trump economy because of his leadership.</p><p>They're also saying that the president has been unfairly accused. One thing Americans don't put up with is bullying. And they're tired of being bullied, they're tired of seeing President Trump be bullied by the mainstream liberal media and those are aligned with him in the Senate. We're not going to let that happen.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So the issue of this not being a real trial because there weren't witnesses and more documents.</p><p>LEE: Look, in every court in America -- let's take every trial court in the federal judiciary. You have federal district courts. Those are trial courts. And yet, most proceedings, whether they're civil or criminal that come before the trial court don't culminate in a full-blown trial. Why? Because courts have -- not only the power but also the obligation to not continue to accumulate more evidence once there is no material dispute in the facts in front of them. That's what we face in this case. There is no need for any additional evidence because it wouldn't change any material fact before us.</p><p>BREAM: What we've been hearing the last couple of weeks that it's not just the president who is on trial, it is the senators themselves. The Washington Post, their editorial board under the headline, ""The Cringing Abdication of Senate Republicans"" writes this, ""Americans who object to Mr. Trump's relentless stonewalling and Republican's complicity can take some comfort in the prospect that most or all of the evidence the White House is hiding will eventually come out.""</p><p>They talk about John Bolton's book. The fact that we're going to know more in a few weeks. They say, ""We can only hope that voters who wanted that evidence to be heard in the trial will respond by showing incumbent senators that they are a force to be reckoned with.""</p><p>How do you respond to the -- you know, the line that has been you guys are the ones who are on trial here. And at least most of the mainstream media doesn't like the way you performed?</p><p>LEE: Look, I know that the journalist wing of the Democratic Party, which is to say basically all journalists, present company perhaps excluded, it's not my place to presume, feel that way. I get it. But the American people aren't aligned with them. That statement reflects a real arrogance and simultaneous arrogance.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that if there is evidence that they want out, Adam Schiff can still go get it on his committee. I think it's foolishness, they can bring other impeachment proceedings if they want to. I think that would be foolishness too. And it's only going to secure their own political detriment.</p><p>But they're wrong to say that somehow this is the Senate's fault but the Senate is on trial. Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler were on trial and they didn't fare well.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Senator Lee, it's been long week. Thanks for popping in.</p><p>LEE: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: Good to see you. All right. New tonight, U.S. officials believe the leader of Al Qaeda in Yemen is dead killed by an American airstrike. They believe Qassim al-Rimi (ph) died earlier this month. Now, officials are reportedly waiting for confirmation before making a formal announcement.</p><p>Also tonight, the Trump administration expanding its immigration restrictions to six additional countries. Officials say those nations do not meet security standards. They're Kyrgyzstan, Burma, Eritrea, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania.</p><p>Immigrants from those countries will face new restrictions and obtaining certain visas to come to the U.S. The ACLU says the ban should be ended, not expanded, calling the policy anti-Muslimism.</p><p>Well, an acquittal with an asterisk. Debating the end of the impeachment trial with co-host of ""THE FIVE,"" Juan Williams and senior advisor to the Trump 2020 campaign, Mercedes Schlapp, they're next.</p><p>BREAM: Tuesday State of the Union Address is firmly on the calendar. According to a senior administration official, the White House is preparing a speech that will lay out a vision of, quote, relentless optimism and unity. And can the president also declare victory?</p><p>Well, let's bring in co-host to ""THE FIVE"" Juan Williams and senior advisor to the Trump 2020 campaign, Mercedes Schlapp. Welcome to both of you.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, SENIOR ADVISOR TO THE TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Hi.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Let's start with this. Senator Elizabeth Warren, I was just talking with Senator Lee about how they obviously don't see eye to eye on this whole thing. She tweets this. ""The only force that's powerful enough to stop Trump and the Republicans is us, the American people. They want us to be discouraged and feel helpless because they're afraid of what will happen when we all come together and take up each other's fights.""</p><p>Mercedes, is this going to backfire? There's a lot of folks that feel there's momentum, it's great for the president. Obviously, to have an acquittal, if he wins here on Wednesday, as it appears to be. But is the base on the other side going to be more fired up than ever because turnout is everything?</p><p>SCHLAPP: I mean, there is no question that our base -- and I'm going to say this. It's not just our base, because our base is expanding. This is about bringing in those Democrats, those independents, especially those Democrats who are looking at their party and saying, wait a second here. What are our options? A socialist, a socialist and a socialist.</p><p>And so there is major concern about the fact that what -- the Democrat Party, they're filled with weak frontrunners. There's really no one frontrunner right now if you're looking at these individual states. And so this is very problematic for the Democrats.</p><p>I think for the Republicans, when we have seen this illegitimate impeachment process, where we have seen the fact that they've made these weak articles of impeachment something that just wouldn't pass or fly in the Senate, I think the American people are looking at this, saying, this was clearly a political sham. We know exactly what the Democrats wanted to do with the president since day one and so this is why they're focused on making sure that, you know, the president gets through the next election in 2020 and wins.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Juan, so a couple of things to unpack there with you. First of all, how worried are you about the party nominating somebody who is openly a socialist by his own self-description? And also, secondly, the fact that there are those Trump supporters who are more frustrated and angry than ever about the way they believe he's been treated by the media and by Democrats?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think the president feeds those grievances and use it to stir up the base. I don't think there's any question about that.</p><p>I saw an AP-NORC poll today said that in fact, the Republican base looks more energized than the Democratic base at the moment. But I also know, and this, you know, it just doesn't stop. I mean, it just keeps going.</p><p>Like today, just look at the news today. You have the New York Times reporting that John Bolton's book indicated that he was in the room not only with the president, but with Pat Cipollone, the president's lawyer being told to have the president of the Ukraine meet with Rudolph Giuliani.</p><p>And again today, you hear the former chief of staff, John Kelly, saying this is going to be half a trial. You know, that 75 percent of the American people including -- you know, most -- it's not -- no, not a majority but a large segment of Republicans want witnesses, 75 percent.</p><p>BREAM: Yes. But they may want Hunter Biden, Juan. I mean, that may be who they want.</p><p>WILLIAMS: We're talking here about Bolton, we're talking about Mulvaney --</p><p>BREAM: Well, if they're asked specifically about that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- we're talking people with direct knowledge of these events. So when you hear Senators like Murkowski who, of course, today said that, you know, she could not vote to have witnesses because it's not a fair trial, but you also hear Rubio and others say, you know, the president they behaved inappropriately. It looks like Republicans are making excuses --</p><p>BREAM: But there's plenty of behavior...</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- and then asking people just ignore, but the drip and drip continues.</p><p>BREAM: Listen. There's plenty -- well, that's another question. But there are plenty of people across the political spectrum who think there are who have engaged in all kinds of inappropriate or the wrongful behavior, they don't think it's becoming of a president. It's a whole another thing to say that it's impeachable though.</p><p>And there are Democrats and Republican who would say that. But to the issue of the dripping of information, the timing, to a lot of people, of course, Mercedes, starts to look suspicious. And listen not wrapping this up tonight is worrisome, I think. You tell me for the White House, for the president no vote until Wednesday. How many more things are we going to get from the New York Times?</p><p>SCHLAPP: Well, you know, I think that it's not about the New York Times at this point. When you're looking at the fact that the House of Representatives obviously, they talked about overwhelming evidence that they had, well, they had a very weak case.</p><p>And what we know is that they were -- they wanted these House managers wanted the Senate to basically expand their impeachment role, meaning, they wanted them to listen to additional witnesses. Well, it is the job of the House of Representatives to basically move forward on this impeachment inquiry. It's not that job of the Senate, that would set up a very dangerous precedent for the Senate.</p><p>So the House instead rushed the process. It was a partisan process and then all of a sudden they're trying to throw it over to the Senate to say, hey, you all have to listen to additional witnesses. Well, even those moderate Republicans, many that don't agree with the president, they basically said no way. We're not moving in this direction.</p><p>So I really think for the president--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know what? If I can respond to that quickly.</p><p>SCHLAPP: -- this has been a win --</p><p>BREAM: OK. Let's get Juan in here for response.</p><p>SCHLAPP: -- and we need to turn the page and move on. The American people are tired of the Democrats continual abuse of power in terms of what they've done with this impeachment and how they tried to remove this president, try to lower the standards of impeachment.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Juan, close us out.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think the real tragedy here is that we have allowed the president to obstruct justice. I think that it's the case that not only has the president not, you know, testified himself and said, here, I didn't do anything wrong --</p><p>SCHLAPP: Wait a second.</p><p>WILLIAMS: His lawyers haven't said that. And secondly he's encouraged -- hang on a second, Mercedes.</p><p>SCHLAPP: The House didn't even give him his due process rights. That is the biggest B.S., Juan, I'm sorry.</p><p>BREAM: Time out. Time out.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Hang on a second. He has -- he has discouraged other members of the administration from testifying and kept documents from the State Department, the Justice Department away from a legitimate impeachment inquiry.</p><p>BREAM: But as a president, you have the executive privilege, Juan. But Juan, at least those things could be -- those things could be litigated. You don't automatically rollover on those no matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat president. There are privileges you can assert that has to be litigated. The House chose not to do that and now it looks like it's going to happen.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But, Shannon, that would have been -- that would have been playing into the White House strategy of simply slow walking this and making it irrelevant.</p><p>BREAM: Courts are not irrelevant though they're there for a reason.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And there's no requirement that it goes to the courts. In fact, the Congress has sole power over impeachment.</p><p>BREAM: We got to leave it there. But the courts are there for a reason, I think we can all agree on that.</p><p>Mercedes and Juan, have a great weekend. Good to see you both.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Thank you so much.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Enjoy the Super Bowl.</p><p>BREAM: You're down there in Miami. You enjoy it for all of us.</p><p>OK. Our special impeachment coverage continues with the Fox News @ Night exclusive. GOP senator from Georgia, Kelly with the governor from Georgia, Kelly Loeffler, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): I've got to bet that the people in Iowa understand that I'm doing my job. I'm in the arena. You know, other people can say I don't even want to look at what's going on there. I've got to do my job and get to the truth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: All eyes turning to Iowa now. Presidential hopeful Senator Sanders, Warren, Klobuchar, and Bennet, hightailing of the Nation's Capital tonight. The impeachment trial reconvening on Monday. And the final vote is expected on Wednesday.</p><p>Let's turn to Republican Senator from Georgia Kelly Loeffler for more. Welcome, Senator, good to have you. For the first time with us on FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.</p><p>SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA): Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: I got to ask you. You're one month into being in the Senate. We talked about during the commercial, your first, your second day, and your brief on the Soleimani strike, and now, you're in the middle of an impeachment trial. What is it been like, this baptism by fire for you?</p><p>LOEFFLER: Well, it's actually been great because I feel like I'm here helping fight the good fight for the president and making sure that we get past this partisan impeachment, which I'm really excited to be able to say that today was a big win. And it looks like we're heading toward bipartisan acquittal, hopefully, next week so it was great.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So Alyssa Milano, a celebrity who is clearly not a fan of Republicans or the president says, ""Witnesses are dead. You guys voted against that. Not going to happen. The ""removal,"" she says in quotes, ""will have to happen on Election Day. Are you ready to work harder than you've ever worked before? Yes, me, too. We've got to show up in massive numbers so the 2020 election is hashtag too big to ignore.""</p><p>This is the question now that we keep debating. Is the left going to be so fired up by what they see as a major grievance of this president getting away with what they see as impeachable behavior, they're going to be fired up and it's going to be a tough fall at the polls?</p><p>LOEFFLER: That's fair. I don't think it resonates with most Democrats though. I think they have to have seen that this was the most unfair partisan impeachment. I think the Republicans are fired up. I think they saw what happened. An election was trying to get stolen out from under them from 2016 and even 2020. So I think people are going to be fired up for Republicans. And I think our case was well proven and I'm ready to go and help get President Trump reelected in Georgia.</p><p>BREAM: Did you feel the pressure? Because there was constant scrutiny on every single vote, how it was going to go for witnesses, for acquittal, we're still not there yet. Especially as the newest senator. Did you feel that?</p><p>LOEFFLER: Certainly, I did. I took pages of notes. I filled up a notebook and a half taking notes, making sure that we gave the president the fair trial that he deserved, that he did not get in the House. And look, I think at the end of the day, the articles, both articles fell woefully short of proving any kind of crime. And I think it also raised a lot of questions about the conduct of the House Managers, what happened with Hunter Biden, what's going on with the whistleblower? So, I think it just opened up more questions for them.</p><p>BREAM: And we have some of those, we're actually going to debate with one of our legal panels a little bit later, too. So also, you're in the headlines this week, because Congressman Doug Collins, who has been a -- from Georgia, obviously -- and a huge supporter of the President, as well, one of his biggest defenders out there has decided that he wants to run for the Senate seat as well. It's not a traditional primary for this seat. It's one of these jungle primaries. He's taking some hits and some criticism, but what do you make of this now that you'll have two strong Republican voices, an incumbent, but a very vocal congressman here, too, jumping in?</p><p>LOEFFLER: Well, certainly, I'm the President's biggest defender and supporter. I'm going to be working hard to advance his agenda, not just in Georgia, but for our country. In fact, I came into politics only a month ago, like you said. And eight weeks ago, I was running a company in the private sector. And really, I saw the work that President Trump was doing his agenda, working to raise all Americans up. We have this blue collar, boom, we're setting all kinds of employment records, and, you know, fighting for our national security, taking out terrorists, securing the border, there's so much good work going on that I was so inspired to come into this role, and I'm going to fight for Georgia and I'm going to run to win in 2020.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So, you know, you have skeptics, people who were worried when you came in the president, you know, was in favor of Congressman Collins. The governor chose you. He's confident in his choice. And there were questions about some who thought that you were too moderate for some of the Republican Party. Chris Cillizza writing this about you critiquing Mitt Romney and his decision about his votes this week saying: ""Loeffler chose to make her critique of Romney as public as possible and by tagging the president in the tweet did everything she could to ensure he saw it, which raises a simple question, why? It says Loeffler needs to prove to conservatives that she can be just as Trumpy as Collins."" Do you feel like you were portrayed accurately as more moderate, not as conservative?</p><p>LOEFFLER: I'm a strong conservative woman. And I think that that maybe was something that intimidated people that wanted to challenge me and that narrative is completely false. I take issue with it. In fact, all my votes have demonstrated so far. Exactly, I'm doing what I said I'd do. I signed on to three pro-life bills in the first two weeks. So, I think, you know, my actions are going to quickly prove out that that narrative is wrong.</p><p>BREAM: OK, Senator, it's great to have you with us. Come back again soon.</p><p>LOEFFLER: Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: Thank you. All right, the final countdown to the first in the nation Iowa Caucus is on. And tonight, new polls show that Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are virtually neck-and-neck. Correspondent Mark Meredith is live tonight in Des Moines. Good evening, Mark.</p><p>MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you, Shannon. There are only a few hours left for the candidates to really try to build up the momentum ahead Monday's caucus, and a lot of these candidates are eager to shake up the leaderboard. Let me show you why. This is the latest poll we're seeing from NBC/Wall Street Journal, giving us an idea nationally about how Democrats feel about the 2020 race. As you can see, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders had leading the race right now, but only slightly and followed right behind by former Vice President Joe Biden.</p><p>We're also watching to see those other front runners including Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar. We're going to be looking to see if the results on Monday here in the caucus mirror what this poll was showing nationally. Now, because of the impeachment trial happening in Washington, Bernie Sanders, the front runner, hasn't been able to be on the campaign trail here in Iowa the last couple of days. Today, we saw his wife out on the trail teaming up with Documentary Filmmaker, Michael Moore. The two spoke to a crowd earlier today, and they said that Sanders is ready to be the party's standard bear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JANE SANDERS, BERNIE SANDERS' WIFE: We feel very, very confident that Bernie is the candidate that can beat Trump. The more people get to know Bernie, the more they liked him, the more they trust them. And that is outside of the Democratic Party as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEREDITH: Senator Elizabeth Warren is another one of those candidates that had been stuck back in Washington. So, they, of course, will be coming out here for the campaign events over the weekend. We saw earlier today that Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley was among those people that came out here wanting to get out the vote as well.</p><p>We expect the former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, he'll be hitting the trail for Warren over the weekend. Now, Michael Bloomberg, he's someone who's not expected to be here in Iowa, but a lot of people are going to be watching what's happening in the next several weeks with this campaign, as the DNC is adjusting the rules when it comes to debates that could potentially allow him to jump into the next debate later on in February. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Mark Meredith, we will join you there tomorrow in Iowa. See you soon. Thank you. All right, it got a lot of attention on both sides of the aisle but with impeachment set to wrap up, will there still be interest in tracking down the truth about Hunter Biden's dealings in Ukraine? Our panel debates, next.</p><p>BREAM: It is the phone call heard around the world, the one at the core of the impeachment trial: President Trump talking to his Ukrainian counterpart about allegations of corruption and more. So, let's look back and see what we know now about the Hunter Biden timeline.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: April 2014. Hunter Biden joins Burisma, widely accused of being corrupt and at the time under investigation by British authorities. He's reportedly paid at least $50,000 a month for his services. That same month, Britain freezes the bank accounts of Burisma's owner, Ukrainian oligarch, Mykola Zlochevsky. Both State Department and White House spokesman claimed they're not concerned about Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma since he's a private citizen.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hunter Biden has not taken a position with the largest oil and gas company, holding company, in Ukraine. Is there any concerned about at least the appearance of a conflict there? See, the Vice President's son --</p><p>JAY CARNEY, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I would refer you to the Vice President's office.</p><p>BREAM: Late November 2014, Biden's P.R. push appears to pay off as Burisma teams up with the U.S. agency for international development project. Then, in January, Ukrainian prosecutors refused to cooperate with the British probe. So, the British unfreeze Zlochevsky's accounts. But Western frustrations don't go away. In September 2015, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine calls out Zlochevsky and Burisma in a searing speech and calls for another investigation.</p><p>December 8th, 2015, the former Vice President criticizes Ukrainian corruption and points at the country's Prosecutor General, just one day later, in a piece focusing on Hunter Biden's ties to the oligarch, the New York Times in December 2015 runs a piece stating that the involvement of the Vice President's son with Mr. Zlochevsky's firm undermine the Obama administration's anti-corruption message in Ukraine. February 2nd, 2016, according to a Ukrainian news sites, the country's Prosecutor General seizes Zlochevsky's assets and the article notes that the oligarchy is suspected of criminal offenses including corruption. Three weeks later, February 24th, 2016, a consulting firm called BlueStar Strategies, employing former Clinton officials hired by Burisma requests a meeting with the State Department Undersecretary.</p><p>E-mail communication between the firm and the State Department noted that Hunter Biden is a Burisma board member, and at the consultants wanted to convince the Obama administration that Burisma hadn't engaged in corruption and wanted to change the view of the company in Washington. The next month, March 2016, the former Vice President threatens to hold back a billion dollars in aid if the Ukrainian president doesn't fire the Ukrainian Prosecutor General Victor Shoket, accusing him of corruption. Biden re- counted the conversation years later.</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I said, you're not getting the billion I'm going to be leaving here. I think it was what six hours. I look, I'm leaving the six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: OK. So, with the impeachment trial said to wrap, Wednesday, will there be any further digging into Hunter Biden's business dealings? Should it be over? Let's bring in Fox News Contributor Mo Elleithee and Attorney to President Trump Jenna Ellis. Great to have both of you with us tonight. Welcome.</p><p>JENNA ELLIS, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP: Great to see, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So, what do you think? I mean, Jenna, some people say, listen, he was never the point here, there's nothing to dig into there. It's only because his father is now running that anyone cares. It's time to just shut that door.</p><p>ELLIS: OK, yes. No, well, you know, this has been a thoroughly debunked rhetoric from the Democrats trying to just keep mischaracterize this whole thing as Biden only being a political opponent. Well, you know what other political opponents haven't been called for an investigation by Ukraine. Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg, Harris, Booker, all of the others because their sons weren't potentially part of corruption as well as the vice president, actually calling in the video that you just played: calling for the prosecutor to be fired and withholding aid.</p><p>And so, for President Trump to ask for an investigation into potential corruption, there's never a bad time to follow up on that and make sure that the United States is protecting our interests. And so, I think that the American people want to see justice, we want to make sure that we are fulfilling our obligations to root out corruption, and that's something I think that the American people want to see follow up on.</p><p>BREAM: Well, I mean, the L.A. Times has a piece not known as a conservative newspaper under the headline: ""Hunter Biden may leave a bigger stamp on U.S. politics than his father did,"" saying this: ""Hunter Biden's cash grab at charisma gave Republicans enough material to cover the President's actions in a layer of legitimacy. One of the numerous ironies here is that Hunter Biden may have also damaged his father's presidential bid beyond repair."" I mean, Mo, this is a question that is increasingly coming up for the Vice President. His opponents, you know, they're going to use it when they need to if they feel like he's got to be the front-runner and they want to take him out. It's not a topic that's going away, but it is because of the decisions that Hunter Biden made himself.</p><p>MO ELLEITHEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, maybe, they'll -- look, I'm here in Iowa and listening to Iowans that are asking Joe Biden questions as he travels around the state, this isn't one of them. So, its, its political impact, at least within the Democratic primaries certainly don't seem to be resonant. And I think actually, if anything, what I'm seeing is that it may be creating some sympathy for the Vice President, as people see, this is yet another cheap smear by the president since Joe Biden's the one who actually tried to push out this prosecutor, consistent with the policy of every western country for not going after this oligarch.</p><p>So, look, I don't see the politics of this playing out in a way that's hurting Joe Biden yet and if anything, I this this argument that it's giving Republicans some sort of legitimacy to make this argument. We're not seeing that, right? I mean, when you see people like Lamar Alexander and Rob Portman, even in, even in voting to stop, witnesses in the trial are saying the President did something wrong. Just not wrong enough for impeachment. They're still saying he did something wrong. So, you know, the President certainly looking good in terms of being acquitted, but not good in terms of being fully exonerated.</p><p>BREAM: What about that, Jenna, because we've talked about tonight, there are so many people saying, hey, there's an asterisk. He's not fully vindicated. He never will be.</p><p>ELLIS: Now, that's just ridiculous. And so, when a when a duly appointed arbiter in this case, the Senate, votes for acquittal legally, that means he's not guilty fully. And so, there's no asterisk. There's nothing here. It's a full and complete exoneration, and so you know, that's just rhetoric again. And you know, to push back on Mo, the reason that people who aren't necessarily asking Biden that on the campaign trail is because one either they're his supporters and they know it's a bad question, or two, he's refusing to answer the question. I mean, he's pushed back on reporters. I mean, Fox News' own Peter Doocy, I mean, he, you know, kind of ripped into him one time about that. I mean, so this is actually hurting Biden, and we're seeing that President Trump's poll numbers, his approval ratings are through the roof. I was with him at the rally in Iowa last night.</p><p>ELLEITHEE: That's not true.</p><p>ELLIS: You saw the numbers of just people who absolutely loved him and the support there. So, he's actually doing very well with this whole impeachment sham.</p><p>BREAM: Mo, we'll give you a quick final word to respond to that.</p><p>ELLEITHEE: Yes, his approval ratings aren't through the roof. His approval ratings on the economy are very strong. But what's fascinating is that's not translating to overall approval rating. So, we've never before seen a president who's getting good marks on the economy, but is upside down in his overall approval ratings. It's stuff like --</p><p>ELLIS: He's not upside down.</p><p>ELLEITHEE: It's stuff like can constantly -- in every major poll he is his job approval is upside down.</p><p>BREAM: All right. We're going to leave it there.</p><p>ELLEITHEE: And that's because other people are just tired of this sort of thing.</p><p>ELLIS: Not true. I don't know what polls you're looking at but it definite --</p><p>BREAM: Well, it's true that the economy is good.</p><p>ELLEITHEE: Pretty much every major public.</p><p>BREAM: Got to leave it there, the economy is his bright spot right now. We'll continue to follow the polls. Thank you both, good to see you.</p><p>ELLIS: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Breaking news on the Coronavirus here in the U.S., what you need to know? Next.</p><p>BREAM: Big move tonight by the administration in an effort to stop the Coronavirus outbreak in China from multiplying here at home. The Trump administration declaring a public health emergency, that means foreign nationals who may pose a contamination danger will be banned at least for now. And that's not all, Correspondent Leland Vittert has the very latest for us tonight. Hey, Leland.</p><p>LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Shannon, there's this question they say it's a public health emergency and then at the same time, they say, they think the public is at low risk, so we'll try to break that down as it goes. This is the first type of this quarantine in 50 years and even Americans coming home and escaping the Coronavirus from hot zone are subject to a 14-day quarantine. Here's a picture of the virus as released by the CDC. And while there are relatively few deaths from the coronavirus compared to say the flu, doctors today said that was cold comfort.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Despite the morbidity and mortality with influenza, there's a certainty for example of seasonal flu. I can tell you all guaranteed that as we get into March and April, the flu cases are going to go down. The issue now with this is that there's a lot of unknowns. As you can see, just from the media, the number of cases have steeply inclined each and every day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VITTERT: All right, so we'll take a look at the spread: 250-plus deaths in China. 11,700 cases reported that's up by about 1700 since just yesterday. 100 plus cases reported outside of China. And this is much different than the Ebola outbreak where it was pretty easy to tell us folks traveled, who was sick.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Remember back with Ebola, doesn't get transmitted, unless you're actively very ill. And you know that it's very, very clear. When you can transmit a virus at a time when you're asymptomatic, that just puts the extra burden on screening.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VITTERT: All right, speaking of screening, American and Delta are going to suspend service to China. Other countries are limiting flights. Americans still trying to get home from the hot zone are going to have issues in terms of where they can come into in the United States. Only seven airports will be able to accept flights from China.</p><p>And Shannon, tonight, sources I talked to, not necessarily on the medicine side, but on the intelligence, side are wondering about the Chinese response. They've shut down cities larger than New York but say they think they have things that are control. Those messages don't necessarily match.</p><p>BREAM: All right, Leland, thank you for updating us. OK, it is considered to be one of the biggest human trafficking events worldwide. countdown time for Super Bowl 54, and ICE agents already hitting the streets of Miami to check it out. Correspondent Doug McKelway has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: For host cities, the Super Bowl presents a chance to shine in the spotlight of tens of millions of viewers to profit from tourism, but also to crack down on human trafficking.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have zero tolerance here. We'll come after you.</p><p>MCKELWAY: Before last year, Super Bowl and Atlanta, police made 169 human trafficking arrests up from 110 in Minneapolis the year before. Expect more arrests this year in Miami.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We partnered with Uber. We partnered with the Trucking Association; we've trained drivers to spot on the interstate coming down to the Super Bowl because that's how they'll come.</p><p>MCKELWAY: This year's Super Bowl coincides with Human Trafficking Awareness Month in today's White House Summit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: At age 13, I was brought into this country. I survived trafficking along with 19 other girls. You are never too old, to lost, or too broken to begin healing today.</p><p>MCKELWAY: That's also where Attorney General William Barr said technology is both helping in hindering, sometimes leaving a digital trail to offenders, sometimes masking that trail.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Now, we're seeing military grade encryption being marketed on consumer products like cell phones. This means that we cannot get access to this data.</p><p>MCKELWAY: For all the public relations advantages, the Super Bowl offers to addressing this heinous worldwide crime.</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISOR: An estimated 24.9 million people trapped in forced labor, domestic servitude, or commercial sex trafficking.</p><p>MCKELWAY: Some say, it's disingenuous and unfair to link it to the Super Bowl because statistical evidence that human trafficking increases during the Super Bowl is inconclusive. A university of Minnesota review concluded: ""Super Bowl's do generate an increase in advertisements for sex, but not to the degree that is often publicized in the media.""</p><p>And the University of Arizona study found: ""There is no empirical evidence that the Super Bowl causes an increase in sex trafficking compared to other days and events throughout the year, though there was a noticeable increase in law enforcement activities intended to locate victims.""</p><p>That is not to say that human trafficking is not a huge problem. It is. One that's all the more difficult to address because it thrives in the shadows of homelessness, broken families, runaway from teams and mental illness. Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: Doug McKelway, thank you very much. That's it for tonight. Most- watched, most trusted, most grateful you spent the evening with us. Good night from Washington. We'll see you from Iowa. I'm Shannon Bream.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier

Have a great night. Tucker Carlson is coming up next.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. It's been an awfully long week, but thank God we're ending it tonight with two pieces of good news.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">The first, Great Britain is an independent country again, as it has been for most of the last thousand years. Brexit has gone through. So cheers to our friends in the U.K.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">In this country, the impeachment farce is almost over. That's our good news. The President will be acquitted. Now, we knew that from the first day, of course, which is one of the reasons this whole overhyped charade was always such an insulting waste of time.</p><p>But now it is official, even the wettest, Trump hating Republicans in the Senate are thoroughly sick of this. They want it over. And yet because once started, nothing in Washington ends easily, the process continues on like a ghost ship. Here was the scene in the Senate floor today.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)</p><p>CARLSON: Those are actually retail drunk shoppers in box stores on Black Friday, but it's the same sickness at work. Mobs of desperate people grasping at trinkets to fill a void within. It's sad to watch.</p><p>Let's try to find the actual tape from the Senate.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)</p><p>CARLSON: Nope. Once again, right theme, wrong video. Jerry Springer wasn't really in the Senate this week. But Jerry Nadler was. Check out what happened last night when Chief Justice Roberts asked prosecutors to answer a final question.</p><p>Nadler and Adam Schiff raced to the podium, all but elbowing each other out of the way to get one last blessed moment on C-SPAN. Watch this tape and ask yourself if you have ever seen anything with less dignity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE: Could you please respond to the answer just given by the President's counsel and provide any other comments the Senate would benefit from hearing before we adjourn for the evening.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.</p><p>REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Senate --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I want to be on TV. No, I do. These people are buffoons. That clip really was the whole impeachment from start to finish -- narcissistic, degrading, pointless -- a nation as great as this one deserves more, but that would require impressive leaders.</p><p>At some point, maybe next week, we'll look back on this whole chapter in shame. But for a few more days, at least, the hysteria will continue. In fact, it will likely increase, believe it or not.</p><p>The media class seemed to be just figuring out the Trump will not be removed from office before the Super Bowl. You've always known that, obviously. They had no idea. They're literally stunned.</p><p>Over on MSNBC, a person called Mara Gay declared that if the results of the last election aren't nullified immediately, democracy is dead forever. Think about that for a minute. She clearly hasn't. It's kind of hilarious actually. Watch her tantrum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARA GAY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"": What's on trial is not just Donald Trump right now, what's on trial is the rule of law. What's on trial is our democracy.</p><p>I mean, what a sad moment after, you know, 300-plus years of democracy.</p><p>And by the way, truth matters. I mean, as a journalist, I just think that's what separates us from Russia, from Venezuela.</p><p>If we don't stand up for truth now, it will be too late. It will be too late.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: As a journalist -- as a journalist. And that was your tip that Mara Gay isn't just some fake Democratic strategist they invited on a cable show like they often do. She's in fact a member of ""The New York Times"" Editorial Board, not that that makes her a journalist, but she's still the best they can muster. Ponder that over the weekend.</p><p>The politics editor of theroot.com, meanwhile, told viewer that now that Donald Trump is staying in office until November, nothing can stop him from becoming an authoritarian dictator.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JASON JOHNSON, POLITICS EDITOR, THE ROOT.COM: Imagine Donald Trump deciding sometime in June. Well, I heard this conspiracy theory that a whole lot of illegal immigrants voted in California. So I've decided that during the presidential election, California has to undergo extreme vetting because we can't trust their votes. We're going to shut down voting in a state. This is literally the kind of thing he will do now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Got that? Trump is ""literally"" going to cancel the election in California, our biggest state. Okay, Jason Johnson, let us know when he tries.</p><p>People like Johnson are saying things like this because they are so shocked their brains no longer work. They really thought Trump was going to be fired at the end of impeachment. They thought a five-minute phone call on Hunter Biden's corruption would be enough to undo an election that 136 million people voted in.</p><p>Like a creepy old man in a porno theater, the press and the Democratic Party allowed their fantasies to over strip reality. But they're about to be shocked back to consciousness very soon.</p><p>The Iowa caucuses are just three days from now. Bernie Sanders is likely to win there. His only real rival is a man who should be having dinner at 4:30 at Golden Corral.</p><p>Party leaders don't really want either one of them -- Sanders or Joe Biden -- their plan, the plan in Washington is to force voters to back Michael Bloomberg, a Napoleonic billionaire known for screaming at people who drink the wrong soda.</p><p>None of it seems very appealing. The Democratic Party is in trouble. It's about to collide with itself. And by the way that didn't need to happen. If Democrats had just spent the last three years coming up with -- I don't know -- a credible plan to lower housing prices, or raise middle class wages, or fix the student loan crisis, they might be winning the election, but they didn't do that.</p><p>Instead, they tried the easy way out. They wasted their energy on wild conspiracies about Russia and Ukraine, and while they were doing that, they're unhappiest, but most energetic activists forced their candidates to take lunatic positions on abortion, guns, race, gender, climate, you name it. Positions that are way out of the mainstream, even among Democrats.</p><p>It adds up to a disaster and they know it's a disaster. That's why they're so upset.</p><p>The good news is, as awful and stupid as impeachment was, in the end, it hurt the people who did it most of all.</p><p>We're joined now by Congressman Devin Nunes of California. Great to see you, Congressman. So --</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): Great to be with you.</p><p>CARLSON: We got an indication from Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee last night late that we're not going to get witnesses in the Senate portion of this proceeding. And basically, there's nothing left. There is going to be a vote, the President is going to be acquitted. So why is it continuing exactly, do you know?</p><p>NUNES: Well, they have to actually get to the point of where they actually vote to acquit, which I guess is going to occur on Wednesday, so they had to vote on the rules for that.</p><p>But I actually have some bad news for you tonight, Tucker, on a Friday night.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay.</p><p>NUNES: I know you don't want the bad news, but --</p><p>CARLSON: I'm used to it.</p><p>NUNES: The President is going to be acquitted, but the problem is this isn't going to end. Like I just can't imagine that Adam Schiff after three and a half years of this nonsense, and Jerry Nadler are not going to continue this, right?</p><p>They're going to go back and they're going to subpoena John Bolton. We're going to have the same exact thing that you've been seeing for the last three and a half years. I just think you should prepare.</p><p>We thought once Mueller collapsed completely, we thought, okay, we're going to get on to business. And then out of nowhere, this Ukraine hoax appeared and look, this really is a hoax.</p><p>This was Adam Schiff and his staff concocting this all together with people that all know each other. All these people know each other that concocted this stupid Ukraine hoax that we've been dealing with for the last week in the Senate.</p><p>So anyway, bad news for you the night. I bet even after the acquittal, we're going to be working on this.</p><p>CARLSON: So since you're an elected official and you know a lot about policy, but also politics, is there any evidence that this works? I mean, my read on it is the candidates who win are the ones that speak to the issues that people really care about. They don't care about this demonstrably. So why are Democrats continuing to do this?</p><p>NUNES: Well, I described it earlier this week as the Democratic Party is like the dog that caught the car. And now they've been promising all this crazy stuff, and now they're going to get somebody who's not even a Democrat, Bernie Sanders as their nominee.</p><p>A month ago, I would have said, nah, you know, Bernie is going to get second or third or probably not going to win. I mean, he's winning in every state, including California, which is the big prize, which is essentially a month away.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NUNES: And he's winning in Iowa. I mean, this could be -- if Bernie wins on Monday night, you have an entire takeover by the extreme left of the historic Democratic Party. It no longer -- it ceases to exist. It's going to be the Socialist Party.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, so can I ask you another political question. So this is essentially a replay of what happened with Donald Trump in the Republican Party. The establishment hated him. They tried to rig the system to prevent him from becoming the nominee, and it didn't work.</p><p>The Democrats are trying the same thing. They're talking about tampering with delegates at the convention now. Will that work?</p><p>NUNES: Well, I think there's a big difference between Trump and Bernie Sanders here.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course, there is.</p><p>NUNES: So Trump and I mean, just in the politics of this, Bernie Sanders is a socialist. I mean, the guy spent his honeymoon in the Soviet Union.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NUNES: Right? Donald Trump had -- you know, he had his own brand of politics that I think caught everybody off guard, but he does believe in a few important things, right?</p><p>He wants to -- he has been very clear. He was against the Iraq War from the very beginning. He wants to bring the troops home as much as he can. He also wanted to redo trade deals.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>NUNES: All things that people including myself, were very skeptical of if he could actually deliver on some of this. But I think despite all the craziness and for three and a half years, well, really since the end of 2015, Donald Trump and his campaign being under investigation by the Feds, the Clinton campaign, the Democrats in the House, despite all of that, the guy is defying the odds.</p><p>I mean, I would have never thought that we could have not only rewrote NAFTA, but actually passed it. It was one of the most popular trade agreements ever passed in the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p><p>I mean, it's amazing what he's actually accomplished here despite everything.</p><p>CARLSON: I remember -- yes, and in the end, that's I think -- I think that's what matters. Congressman, thanks so much for coming on tonight. I appreciate that.</p><p>NUNES: Thank you, Tucker. Always a pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: So we've been through all of this. We're at the end of it. What did it add up to? Who better to ask than Chris Bedford. He's a senior editor at ""The Federalist"" and he joins us on set tonight.</p><p>Chris, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>CHRIS BEDFORD, SENIOR EDITOR, ""THE FEDERALIST"": Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So you watched every second of this. What does it amount to? What does it mean?</p><p>BEDFORD: It's also -- this is very much stupid as it seemed from the very beginning, because it's amazing to watch these professional political watchers on some other channels act surprised.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD: We've known exactly what's going to happen since Nancy Pelosi won the House and Mitch McConnell held the Senate. The House was going to impeach Donald Trump. The Senate was going to acquit Donald Trump. The end.</p><p>But it's still going on and on and on and people are acting like if we don't have an 18th witness for this trial, then the whole world's going to catch on fire.</p><p>Now, the problem here is that the Democrats are blaming the system. They've been doing this since the beginning. They want to tear down basically anything that doesn't work for them.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD: So the election, the Electoral College, grading in schools. I mean, we just saw that in Brexit, the U.S. Senate, the whole world catches on fire if they don't get their exact result, so they need to tear it all down.</p><p>They're going to push again for that. I think Nunes is right -- Congressman Nunes -- that this is going to continue. The investigations will continue. The stupid will continue. But the Senate at least will be freed up.</p><p>CARLSON: It is stupid, though. I mean, and maybe this is just wish fulfillment. I think this was appalling. I don't think it should be rewarded. So I want to believe it will be counterproductive.</p><p>But I haven't seen one piece of polling data showing that this is a massive win for Democrats. Meanwhile, their party is being taken over by people who are going to destroy the party.</p><p>So this -- it just seems like a highly stupid path for them to continue going down.</p><p>BEDFORD: There was one week of clarity you might remember after Donald Trump was elected when everyone was kind of shell shocked and a little bit honest with themselves and said, wow, maybe we've forgotten the working class of America, maybe we're not paying attention to the opioid addiction. Maybe jobs going overseas is a bad thing and we should pay attention to this.</p><p>And then it was quickly forgotten, and before you knew it, Jeff Sessions with the KGB agent and a Klansman at the same time, and this narrative has continued, and that's not something that's good for winning voters.</p><p>If you actually care about your family and your job is not to watch all this insanity all day, then that's not helping you at all. None of this is helping you, and you're going to going to vote against it.</p><p>CARLSON: Ce rewind a little bit? Why do you think -- this is maybe unknowable -- but why do you think that moment of clarity passed so fast? The lessons of the election in 2016 were very clear. You forget about voters, they will vote against you. Democratic voters went for Trump. Democrats forgot that, like within about a day. Why?</p><p>BEDFORD: It was like a retreating army when there's just chaos everywhere and everyone is to take care of themselves. Maybe think for themselves for a minute, and then the generals got back in charge and said, wait, wait, wait, guys, remember, they are racist.</p><p>Donald Trump is a racist. Half of America is horrible. The system didn't work. And they said, oh my gosh, you're right. Russia -- a couple of Russian trolls are the reason why Hillary Clinton lost. I guess her plane was rerouted from campaigning in the Midwest.</p><p>It's completely insane, and it's just a denial. But I think it's the Democrats getting back into order and saying you're right, you're right. This is not us. This is everybody else.</p><p>CARLSON: So you watch all this stuff, and you think, you know, this isn't happening by accident. Somebody orchestrated this. Somebody thought it was a good idea.</p><p>Those are the exact same people who are telling us they must be in charge of the country. This seems like proof positive, they should not have power.</p><p>BEDFORD: They shouldn't have power, and I think it looks like right now, Donald Trump is cruising for reelection because he is up against a group of people who are doing very well.</p><p>Bernie Sanders is the only maybe honest politician -- he lies about numbers -- but on the Democratic side, who's telling the voters exactly what he's going to do, and all the D.N.C. is trying to do is tear him down. All the Democratic Party is trying to do is destroy his chances of winning, whether it's with Bloomberg or changing rules, which means they're going to get a Civil War on their hands because voters are mad.</p><p>CARLSON: So wait, you mentioned numbers -- last question, what do you think if you could put a number on it is the audience -- the receptive audience - - for woke politics? Like what number of Americans actually likes that crap?</p><p>BEDFORD: I think you add the journalists and the college students of D.C., New York and Los Angeles together, maybe a few in San Francisco and divide it by two. That's it.</p><p>CARLSON: That's not 270 electoral votes.</p><p>BEDFORD: No, it's not.</p><p>CARLSON: Chris Bedford, great to see you tonight. Thank you.</p><p>BEDFORD: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Democratic insiders frantically hope that Michael Bloomberg, their billionaire savior will swoop in and save the party for himself.</p><p>Now, they're trying to rig the process to help that happen. We will tell you how.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, as you remember, during the 2016 election, leaked e-mails proved that the Democratic National Committee sided with Hillary Clinton and rigged the primaries to hurt Bernie Sanders, and the nomination to her. It worked obviously. It wasn't even necessary, really.</p><p>But the fact it came out may have cost them the General Election. Democrats who were for Bernie were outraged. So that was counterproductive.</p><p>Four years later, though, the Democratic Party seems determined to make exactly the same mistake. So far, presidential candidates have had to raise money from thousands of individual small donors in order to qualify for the primary debates.</p><p>Why did the party do this? Because they wanted prevent a wealthy billionaire, for example, with no grassroots support from buying his way onto the stage.</p><p>Oh, wait. But now they want a wealthy billionaire with no grassroots support on the stage. So the rules are changing, so Michael Bloomberg can rescue them from Bernie Sanders.</p><p>Today, the D.N.C. announced that there will be no donor threshold for making its upcoming debate in Nevada, or Nevada, as they now call it. The decision drastically increases the likelihood that the Napoleonic figure from New York will qualify for the debate. What does this all mean?</p><p>Chris Plante knows. He hosts radio's ""The Chris Plante Show"" which is excellent. He joins us tonight. Chris, great to see you. Do you feel like you've seen this movie?</p><p>CHRIS PLANTE, RADIO HOST, THE CHRIS PLANTE SHOW: You know, it just gets more and more ridiculous with each passing day when you think it's impossible that it couldn't become more ridiculous. It becomes yet more ridiculous.</p><p>Here's a guy, you know, if you looked up his numbers recently, he has gained about $2 billion dollars in wealth over the last several weeks, spent $100 million of his own dollars so far on TV ads that are all anti- Trump ads, and President Trump's numbers are going up, during the impeachment, during Bloomberg's anti-Trump ads, Trump's numbers are actually going up.</p><p>And he's buying an $11 million 60-second spot at the Super Bowl day after tomorrow, Mike Bloomberg, with his own money -- with his own money.</p><p>And you may recall just a short time ago, as you started to describe. The Democrats are very anti-billionaire, anti-one percent or anti-money in politics and the terrible influence of the Emoluments Clause. Right?</p><p>I think there is still lawsuits going on --</p><p>CARLSON: The Emoluments Clause, yes.</p><p>PLANTE: Now, how many different businesses does the $60 billion man have his fingers into in media and real estate and all of these things? And he's running and none of this is coming up interestingly enough on CNN and on MSNBC, even among the other Democrats so far.</p><p>But the D.N.C. -- and as the last time they stole it from Bernie and the Bernie Bros who are still furious about this -- they should prepare to get furious again, because they are positioning Bloomberg in there, the billionaire with unlimited funds, forget about all that Emoluments Clause stuff now, because they're looking at their field and they know they've got Joe Biden who, you know, God bless him take the remote control away.</p><p>They've got Bernie Sanders who had a heart attack and attended the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, and they've got Elizabeth Warren who's like the crazy camp counselor that you remember from you know, Camp Hiawatha who danced around the campfire at night, you know making wallets with war paint on them, and she's completely berserk. She is going to have the transgender teenager approve her selection --</p><p>CARLSON: No, nine-year-old.</p><p>BEDFORD: Oh, not even a teenager, a child, a transgender child. She's going to have to go to Hollywood for that to approve her Secretary of -- you were talking about it last night -- of Education choice.</p><p>I mean, these people are nuts. And if you're the D.N.C., you've got to be looking around and saying, can we throw you know a life ring somewhere? Is there anybody out there that can save us?</p><p>CARLSON: But is the lesson right now that America doesn't pay enough attention to billionaires. Let's let a billionaire decide for once. But they don't have enough influence in our society.</p><p>PLANTE: Well -- and this is what -- again, this is -- were it not for double standards, liberals would have no standards at all as a wise man once said. They just make it up as they go along, and today they believe A and tomorrow they believe Z. It's just extraordinary.</p><p>And look, Tom Steyer bought his way onto the stage.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, he did.</p><p>PLANTE: Right? And they've got two -- they're going to have two billionaires, I think they're trying to squeeze him out now, they only have room for one billionaire. And the hypocrisy is astonishing or at least appalling if not astonishing.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I mean -- look, I don't know if -- I don't know what Trump is worth. You know, I have no idea.</p><p>PLANTE: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: But he didn't buy his way into the position.</p><p>PLANTE: No, he didn't.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think he spent any of his own money actually.</p><p>PLANTE: No, no. It's extraordinary. I mean, the double standard is extraordinary. The hypocrisy is extraordinary. I mean, really, it's corruption. These are -- this is corrupt. The D.N.C. is once again rigging the rules to manipulate the process, so that the back room cigar chomping, you know, old school pals are still pulling the strings.</p><p>CARLSON: I've got to say, I hope the Bernie people will fight back.</p><p>PLANTE: I expect they will.</p><p>CARLSON: Chris Plante. Great to see you tonight.</p><p>PLANTE: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you so much. The press is wondering if they simply ignore the fact the President is about to be acquitted, can they pretend impeachment extends for the next nine months. That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the President's impeachment trial is winding down, finally. Senators have rejected any additional witnesses, but a final vote to acquit the President may have to wait until next week, Wednesday, we're hearing tonight.</p><p>Congressman Mike Johnson represents Louisiana and is on the President's defense team. We are happy to have him in the studio tonight. Congressman, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So what remains to be done? Why wait until Wednesday?</p><p>M. JOHNSON: What remains to be done is the senators want to give speeches, so they have to allow a couple of days for that. Monday they come back for closing arguments. There's four hours allotted. I don't think it'll take all that time.</p><p>As you know, the defense side -- our side -- has not been using all the time because you don't have to run the clock out when you have the facts and the law on your side.</p><p>Tuesday they have some speeches that they can go in and pontificate for a while and then Wednesday, we finally get the vote to acquit.</p><p>CARLSON: So this is really more a TV question than a political question, but do we have to pretend it is significant until then or can we just ignore it?</p><p>M. JOHNSON: We can and most of the American public is. No one has been watching this for the last few days because it's so dreadfully boring.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>M. JOHNSON: They regenerated the same arguments over and over and over and it's frankly been painful to watch. I'll tip my hat to the senators who have been able to stay awake somehow, for all this, but as you've been saying in the last couple of segments, this was decided a long time ago. We all knew the outcome and the sooner we get there, the better.</p><p>CARLSON: What do you think the outcome, as numbers matters as they are likely to be -- do you think you'll see any Republicans defect or any Democrats crossover?</p><p>M. JOHNSON: I believe and we expect it will be a bipartisan acquittal. I think we'll get at least two maybe three Democrats, and I think they're going to take a lot of heat over the weekend with people trying to twist their arms, but I think they're going to do the right thing.</p><p>CARLSON: There are Republican senators who would clearly like to convict and expel the President. Mitt Romney obviously would like to do that. Will they dare do you think?</p><p>M. JOHNSON: He can't. There's no way. He has to vote to acquit. I mean, look, if you look at this objectively, as we've proven, I think very well, these are not impeachable offenses. There was no -- there was nothing here. There's no treason, bribery, high crime or misdemeanor, so they really don't have a choice.</p><p>It doesn't matter how much they dislike Donald Trump, you can't kick him out of office. You can't undo the results of the last election as hard as they tried.</p><p>CARLSON: You think this will happen again?</p><p>M. JOHNSON: I do. Look, they are committed to take him out, and our Democratic colleagues, unfortunately, probably a majority of them have committed to do it again. So I don't think this ends and it's a sad and unfortunate chapter in U.S. history and I'm not sure how we get out of it.</p><p>CARLSON: It's pretty much the one thing I never thought would become standard operating procedure.</p><p>M. JOHNSON: No. And they've opened a Pandora's Box, as we've talked about. They've weaponized impeachment. So we're in for a long and dark road, I'm afraid.</p><p>CARLSON: Depressing. Well, luckily, your job as member of the defense team will end soon, so congrats on that. Congressman, thanks very much.</p><p>M. JOHNSON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the President's acquittal is inevitable as it has been since day one. That was clear again in December, and even when this bogus scandal exploded -- it exploded back in September.</p><p>So now the press is scrambling for a way to keep the impeachment story viable beyond next week. So their current phrase of choice, everything is coordinated, in case you haven't noticed, is telling you that the Senate trial is simply a ""fake acquittal.""</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): Here's the deal. You cannot have a true acquittal if you've not had a fair trial.</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): No vindication and no real acquittal for the President because it has become a sham.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): But he will not be acquitted. You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial and you don't have a trial if you don't have witnesses and documentation and that --</p><p>REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): But I fundamentally and strongly agree with Speaker Pelosi's point, in the absence of a fair trial, how can the American people conclude that justice was done?</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The President's acquittal will be meaningless.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Matt Whitaker was the President's acting Attorney General. He joins us tonight. Mr. Whitaker, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>MATT WHITAKER, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Hey, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: It seems like just the other day they were lecturing us about how the President was undermining our institutions and killing public faith and the system et cetera. Now, they're telling us that the trial which played out longer than it needed to in my view wasn't a real trial?</p><p>WHITAKER: It sure seemed boring like a real trial. Everyone I've talked to --</p><p>CARLSON: Good point.</p><p>WHITAKER: But in all seriousness, this is -- it's an impressive trial and let's not confuse a criminal trial or civil trial with, you know, sort of juries of your peers versus a Senate impeachment trial, which is what we saw where the House brings their case over and tries to convince the senators and the senators make the rules, and it's very clear that the President is going to be acquitted, much to the chagrin of all those folks in the video.</p><p>But this is -- this is the way the system works. If you bring a terrible kind of pell-mell case to the Senate, you're going to end up losing it and the President's going to be acquitted.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't even understand the talking points. So you saw the Speaker who really has become a kind of hard eyed extremist, I would say. She used to be kind of a cheerful person, but whatever.</p><p>She said, it's not a trial, because you don't have witnesses and you don't have documentation. I thought the witnesses appeared during the House portion of the proceedings. So I thought there were like 17 witnesses and a ton of documentation or am I missing something?</p><p>WHITAKER: Right. And if you saw the sleight of hand that happened today, they were saying, well, the President could have cross examined witnesses in the Judiciary Committee, but all the witnesses were heard in the Intelligence Committee, so I was a little confused as to where they thought the President could have actually examined --</p><p>CARLSON: But we had a ton of witnesses or am I missing --</p><p>WHITAKER: We had 17, no, we had 17 witnesses and we all watched them.</p><p>CARLSON: They were on TV, right?</p><p>WHITAKER: They were on TV.</p><p>CARLSON: So why are they telling me there were no witnesses. I mean, I think we actually aired it on this show, but I'm getting old, so maybe I missed it. I don't want to be Joe Biden about it. But did have witnesses, right?</p><p>WHITAKER: Right. Yes, we had witnesses in this impeachment proceeding. But again, this is -- these folks expect it to look like a Perry Mason court of law, and that's not what this is. This is an impeachment trial, and this is the way the rules were developed and this is how it ends up.</p><p>CARLSON: So I'm saying this as someone in the news business, but I kind of wanted an endless parade of all -- I want to hear from the buffoons. I'd like to hear Hunter Biden explain how he got his Master's in Ukrainian natural gas exploration.</p><p>WHITAKER: Yes. Well, thank God, you're in the minority, Tucker. Most of us can't bear another day of this.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, that's a fair point.</p><p>WHITAKER: But you know, it is -- there is a bit of Macabre Theatre where folks do want to sort of see politics as almost a sport where we're entertained by it.</p><p>But you know, fundamentally, you know, having served with this President, it would be good to get impeachment behind us, have the acquittal on Wednesday and let him get to continuing to move his agenda forward.</p><p>CARLSON: So if you guess, if you don't mind, do you think that Democrats really want to continue it? Because as I've said, like 50 times, I don't see any evidence they're benefiting from it. I think it's hurting them. Their party is in disarray. They probably want to move on. Or maybe they really do want to continue it. What do they want?</p><p>WHITAKER: They want the narrative, and it's all about the narrative. And so they are keep -- you know, listen, it played out in the House, too. First it was bribery, then it was treason then -- you know, now we've ended up with high crimes and misdemeanors, which they didn't prove.</p><p>All of these senators, both on the right and the left here say you haven't met the constitutional standard, and I think they want to keep the arguments and to bludgeon this President, but to have this whole thing over because they are not looking good.</p><p>Adam Schiff, his team does not look good, and I think some of the senators aren't looking good.</p><p>CARLSON: If you allege -- I mean, you served as Attorney General, if you allege, you know, bribery and treason, shouldn't someone call the cops at some point? I mean, this is like serious stuff that they're alleging.</p><p>WHITAKER: You should. Those are crimes. And the thing that we have here also is they're trying to convince us that the facts are so bad, you must impeach, instead of saying there was a law violated and the facts -- here are the facts, and so you compare to the facts in the law like you would normally would in a court of law.</p><p>Instead, they're just trying to say, these facts are so bad and they're just not. I mean, at the end of the day, this President, you know, has an ability to conduct foreign policy. He was concerned about corruption in the Ukraine. We've seen the transcript and that's -- the case is over for all intents and purposes.</p><p>Except, as the Congressman pointed out, we get to listen to two more days of senators talking.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think it went far enough. He should have canceled aid to Ukraine, in my opinion. There is no reason to send weapons to Ukraine, in my opinion. So I'm on the side that way, at least he delayed it.</p><p>Mr. Whitaker, thank you very much.</p><p>WHITAKER: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to see you. Most Americans still don't know -- no, actually, they're pretty convinced because they were in sixth grade once and took biology there are two sexes.</p><p>Up next though, we will interview a newspaper columnist who was fired for saying that. You just can't. He lost his job. 2020 at work.</p><p>Plus, the Trump administration just set down strict new rules to contain the spread of the coronavirus out of China. We will tell you the state of that epidemic. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: An astonishing scene this evening in New York City, hopefully not a harbinger of the future. Hundreds of people with the Antifa group decolonized this place, swarmed several New York City subway stations. They vandalized the walls. They poured glue on turnstiles.</p><p>They then flooded Grand Central Station in rush hour to confront the police. Five of them were arrested. The ""purpose of the protest"" was to demand the abolition of all fees on the New York City subway because demanding money for a subway ride is racist.</p><p>They also demand removing all police officers from subway trains because to the modern left, normal people exist only to be victimized by criminals, trapped with them in underground tubes with no one to protect them.</p><p>Criminals, meanwhile, should be free to operate with impunity. That's their view explicitly.</p><p>We're following the story closely. We'll have more to say about it on Monday.</p><p>The student loan bubble has grown to more than $1.6 trillion, and that's not just an economic burden for young people, the ones who have to pay the loans off. Those loans are shaping the basic life decisions they make and changing our society.</p><p>According to a new study from LendKey Technologies, about a third of adults between the ages of 18 and 34, said they would consider postponing marriage until they've paid off their student loans.</p><p>One third also said that student debt would influence their choice of spouses. The survey didn't ask young adults about having children, but you know exactly what it would have found.</p><p>For young people, debts mean dreams delayed or destroyed. It means families aren't formed. That's the kind of thing conservatives care about. That's why they exist to fix problems like that. This is the party of family values. Keep in mind, and yet at this very moment, families are disappearing. Why? Well, we know why.</p><p>It's not an unfixable problem. It's not a natural disaster. It's not a matter of culture or values. It's an economic problem that people caused.</p><p>Congress is pumping tens of billions of dollars every year into student loans. Those loans in the end don't help the students. They enrich wealthy colleges and their overpaid administrators who hate you, and then who will hiked tuition by six percent every year.</p><p>This is hurting the country badly and we don't have to tolerate it. We could change law in all kinds of ways. We can make colleges responsible for loans the default, like every other beneficiary of loans, they could cosign.</p><p>We could restrict student loans to schools that let tuition rise too quickly. If you're ripping off kids, we're not going to give you a Federally-backed loans you can build another climbing wall or pay the Minister of Diversity 400 grand a year. We could bar useless programs on all the impoverished kids.</p><p>So far, we haven't done any of that. And one of the main reasons is the Republican Party hasn't tried to do any of that. And that's one of the main reasons the Democratic Party, which is insane and getting crazier, still as a shot to win.</p><p>They're not doing anything about student loans, but they're talking about them. Conservatives should talk about them, too. They're preventing families from forming. We should care.</p><p>Well, the left wants to impeach the President for asking about Hunter Biden's corrupt business deals, but don't worry. They also want to crack down on your ability to say what you want.</p><p>Until this month, Jon Caldara was a conservative columnist at ""The Denver Post."" Now, he's been fired because he would not submit to transgender language dogma. Caldara insisted that ""There are only two sexes."" That was a mistake it turned out. They canned him for that.</p><p>We spoke to Jon Caldara recently. Here's his story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it's a remarkable story, and I should say if you read the whole column, we just read excerpts from it, but you basically say it doesn't -- you know what other people do doesn't bother you, and wear whatever you want, call yourself whatever you want as I read it, and what he basically said was don't tell me to deny biological reality, am I describing that --</p><p>JON CALDARA, FORMER DENVER POST COLUMNIST: It's not even that. You can tell me not to deny but biological reality, but I'm rather libertarian. If you want to wear a dress, wear a dress.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>CALDARA: I'm pro-gay marriage. I'm pro right to die. These things are your business. I believe the individual is sovereign. But that also means that I'm sovereign.</p><p>If you want to wear a dress, go for it. If you want to call yourself a woman, go for it. I will protect your rights. You deserve to be protected for that.</p><p>But in exchange, as a sovereign individual, you don't have control over my speech. And what I've found is if you don't use the speech that the pronoun police give you, you're going to lose your job.</p><p>CARLSON: So you knew that this was something that they have no sense of humor on. They've crushed other people for doing what you did. You did it anyway. Why did you think it was important?</p><p>CALDARA: It was actually a subsequent fact in a larger article. I was doing a piece on the Associated Press Style Book and for your viewers, that's the manual that writers and reporters use to make sure that their language is about the same and grammar is the same.</p><p>And I looked at it, I said, no, they're pushing an agenda through this book. Look at how they say you cannot say illegal alien, but you can say undocumented. When it said there are more than two sexes in the Style Book, obviously, they're making a judgment call that it is now pushing an agenda.</p><p>When they said that the word they is now a singular word, not a plural word, they're making a call.</p><p>So I was bringing a larger point about the AP pushing a leftist agenda, but I got in trouble for saying, no, I think there's only two sexes.</p><p>That doesn't mean there's more than only two sexual identities. You can to identify any way you want. But to say there are two sexes is now a hate crime, considered bigoted and can cost you your voice.</p><p>CARLSON: None of this sounds like journalism, which I was taught 30 years ago was the process of describing reality for readers or viewers. So why is the AP telling you something that is -- well, it's factually untrue, but it's also taking a side in a political debate. Why are they doing that?</p><p>CALDARA: You know, my job was an editorialist. I run the Independence Institute in Colorado at thinkfreedom.org. We're a think tank, but reporters are supposed to tell the truth.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>CALDARA: But when they make the judgment that there are more than two sexes, think of the headline, the other week in ""The Daily Mail,"" I think it was. It said, ""Man gives birth to baby from woman's sperm,"" and it's two fibs in one headline. It's not accurate. So when it comes to science, we will say no to that because we need to push an agenda.</p><p>I think in my case, it was more of we don't want people to feel bad, and we don't want you to write in an insensitive manner. So you can say what you want to say. But you have to use your political opponent's words, when you say it. That's not having your say. That's thought control and speech control.</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right. You have to violate your conscience and lie in order to appease the demands of people you disagree with. When did those become the rules?</p><p>CALDARA: What's odd about this is it comes from a movement that claims to be pushing tolerance. It claims to be pushing diversity. You know, diversity to progressives today seems to be more about skin color and your genitals and your sexual identity than it is diversity of ideas and more importantly, diversity of speech.</p><p>You might talk in one word using all the pronouns that you want to use, I don't speak that way, and I believe people will benefit from hearing two different types of speech.</p><p>It's why my column was the most read column in ""The Denver Post,"" which is a struggling newspaper. It makes little sense to can the most popular column there.</p><p>CARLSON: They fired you anyway. It makes me so grateful to work here where we can say what we think is true, and I just wish you the best. Thank you for your bravery and I hope in the end, you're rewarded for it. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>CALDARA: You too. Thank you for the attention.</p><p>CARLSON: Appreciate it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: The Trump administration has just announced new travel restrictions designed to stem the spread of coronavirus, but at CNN, the only question they're asking is, what's the skin color of the people making these rules? That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: This is a Fox News Alert. The Trump administration has announced new travel restrictions meant to slow the spread of China's deadly coronavirus.</p><p>Foreign nationals who visited China since the virus began spreading are now banned from coming into this country. American citizens who visited the province where it started will be allowed back into the U.S. and will have to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine.</p><p>Coronavirus, in other words is not a small thing. It's a big deal. Thousands of lives are at stake, maybe more.</p><p>But at CNN, not even human life outweighs identity politics, which is all important. A headline yesterday bemoaned that the President's Coronavirus Task Force is ""another example the Trump administration's last of diversity.""</p><p>Buck Sexton hosts ""The Buck Sexton Show."" We're happy to have him tonight. Buck, thanks for coming on. It's funny, I don't ever hear this complaint about Alzheimer's or cancer researchers. They're not diverse enough. Is that a concern too?</p><p>BUCK SEXTON, HOST, THE BUCK SEXTON SHOW: Well, this is just a reminder that CNN will take any opportunity, no matter how absurd to try and criticize this President, even when quite literally, there are lives at stake.</p><p>I mean, people are dying from this. It's a public health emergency. Risk is low right now in this country. But CNN can't miss this opportunity to take some shot at the President of the United States no matter what the damage is to its credibility.</p><p>I mean, we would like to think that when something like this, Tucker, the possibility of a pandemic comes up, maybe CNN could put aside it's pathological Trump derangement syndrome, but clearly they can't.</p><p>And, by the way, given what's happening right now, with the Senate trial, they're going to look for an opportunity to -- whether it's Trump's handling of this, how he talks about this. This is I think, very likely to become another angle of attack. How coronavirus is being handled by the Trump administration, irrespective of what he does.</p><p>CARLSON: So I just can't help but notice that the attack is a very specific kind of attack. I mean, they've been infected by their own virus, the virus of woke politics, which is brain destroying, and you're watching it happen to Elizabeth Warren. It happened to Beto O'Rourke who used to be kind of reasonable. Now, he is like floridly insane.</p><p>The idea that we have to care about the ethnicity of everyone and count people according to their DNA, and then we would like even notice what color are coronavirus researchers are -- like that's like insane.</p><p>SEXTON: Yes, well, this is the kind of the test that people will put out, sometimes. They'll say, half-jokingly, that if Trump cured cancer, CNN would run a story about his authoritarian tendencies in addressing public health crises.</p><p>I mean, and people say this, and they're joking, but then something like this comes up where it is really serious issue, and yet CNN still finds the most urgent thing, the virtue signaling of the identity politics and as you said, has infected the left. I mean, it really actually controls them. It's taken over the host now. It's not just a symptom of other issues.</p><p>CARLSON: It's unbelievable. Let me -- can I ask you a broader question about this? It occurred today. So maybe this is a warning about globalization. I mean, here's a virus in, you know, a faraway province in China that threatens us.</p><p>Maybe one of the reasons United States has thrived for all these years is that we are kind of physically distant from a lot of the rest of the world. Maybe that's not a bad thing necessarily, or always a bad thing. Could this challenge our views about how great a connected world is?</p><p>SEXTON: Well, certainly when you look at the transmission of pandemic disease stretching back for a long time, it's an issue that affects large cities much more than anything else.</p><p>I mean, you look at the explosive growth of cities, particularly in China, the amount of just human density on top of each other, and then the interconnectedness of flights, more flights today than any other time in human history. We're not ready for this.</p><p>And I would just add that the Davos sets spent so much time concerned about a 1.5 degree theoretical raise in the temperature over the next hundred years, and not things like this that in our great grandparents living memory killed 50 million people.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SEXTON: I mean, this is actually really serious stuff, but they'd rather talk about climate change, and you know, get lectures by Greta Thunberg going all over the world. That's what we hear from that set of internationalists.</p><p>CARLSON: And the destruction of nature, which continues at a very brisk pace in China and India, throughout Asia. They're destroying nature. They're polluting the world, dumping garbage into the oceans, killing the fish.</p><p>Like, I don't -- nobody cares, because they're so obsessed with this climate.</p><p>SEXTON: Well, there's a political correctness concern here as well, Tucker, because when we start to talk about the handling of certain food and certain animals that are eaten in China, that's a real thing, but we're not supposed to talk about that here.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I don't care. You know, you shouldn't be eating bats. Okay. That's it. Call me what you want.</p><p>SEXTON: I would not.</p><p>CARLSON: No bat eating, okay?</p><p>SEXTON: Agree.</p><p>CARLSON: Great. A reasonable man, Buck Sexton. Great to see you tonight.</p><p>SEXTON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: No bats. Don't mistreat animals. Gosh. That's it for us tonight. Tune in every night, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.</p><p>Goodnight from Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier

Breaking news tonight, it looks like there will be a vote on Wednesday in terms of what we're hearing. We're going to have Chad Pergram in just a moment to get us - get all this figured out. But we're getting some details tonight. We're moments away from the Senate getting back into session to formalize the plan going forward. They will vote to set the final ground rules for the trial and that will resume on Monday with closing arguments. We have word that the votes on each article of impeachment will come sometime after 4 PM on Wednesday when this trial finally does come to an end, if there is not more twists and turns, which of course there could be.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">No one expects that the outcome will change ultimately. But tonight, Democrats are offering us a preview of what their messaging will be on this. Watch this.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The acquittal will have no value, because Americans will know that this trial was not a real trial.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): You cannot have a true acquittal if you've not had a fair trial.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Trial without witnesses, no trial at all.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: An acquittal on an incomplete record after a trial lacking witnesses and evidence will be no exoneration.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, both sides of the aisle weighing in this evening with Republican Senator Mike Lee and Democratic Senator Bob Casey. A short time ago, I spoke with Utah Senator Mike Lee, a member of the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: How do you respond first of all to the senators in that sound bite and also the House manager who was speaking there as well. Sylvia Garcia, who say even if there is an acquittal in the next few days, it won't be real.</p><p>SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): First of all, they've got due process wrong, due process really is about the rights of the accused relative to the government. They are the accuser. The President is the accused. In any event, they're misapprehending the nature of a trial court. In every trial court in America including the federal district courts, the trial court here within the federal judicial system. It is not only possible; it is the obligation of the court to not allow the case to proceed to a full traditional trial if the civil claims or the criminal charges at issue are legally defective or in many cases there are no genuine issues of material fact.</p><p>The material facts are not in dispute. Both are acceptable answers here and that's why we're not proceeding to trial. But it doesn't make the President's exoneration any less significant. It just means that there was no reason to proceed to a full trial.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, the other concern on the part of some is that this is going to go on and on and that more of this information whether it's coming from John Bolton's book or whether it's Lev Parnas' documents is going to continue to trickle out and that it will make Republicans in the end look bad for not allowing all of this to be put into the mix when the opportunity was still there.</p><p>LEE: Well, look, it's not as if they're going to go away one way or another as a result of this nor is it the case that they wouldn't be able to bring additional charges if they wanted to and then perhaps secure a 33-day delay after passing subsequent articles of impeachment.</p><p>We've got a deal however with the Articles of Impeachment as they sent them to us. In addition to having some inadequacies in and of themselves. There is no genuine issue of material fact as to the evidence in this case, there's no reason to call additional witnesses.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, let's talk about what's going on right now Senator, because there is a lot of behind the scenes, discussion that they - it's very difficult to reach an agreement on how to proceed from here to the point where you have a vote for acquittal and that some senators say they want to be heard. They want to have their moment to speak their mind on the floor of the Senate. How is this all going and where is it all going?</p><p>LEE: Martha, what we expect next is that there will be a series of motions made by the Democrats likely tonight that will probably stretch us for several hours perhaps to midnight or 1 or 2 in the morning, where they'll be coming up with a number of procedural motions. At that point at some point, it'll be possible for us to consider some type of resolution that will set an order moving forward that would allow us to break out of impeachment trial court mode to allow senators to make statements on the floor. That's a possibility.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, I guess what's hard to figure out is when we went into this process, there were the rules that were set. Why didn't the rules govern what would happen at this juncture. Why does it feel like it's sort of thrown up in the air now for new discussion about how it's going to proceed?</p><p>LEE: Yes, that's a good question. The reason that we didn't have that at the outset is that we didn't have consensus in order to set all that in motion. We were able to get 53 votes for the resolution that we got last week on Tuesday. We would have gone further than that if we had had 51 votes or even better 53 at that point. We didn't have them.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, what's the nature of the dispute right now between some Republicans and Mitch McConnell?</p><p>LEE: There's been some back and forth debate today about what it would look like, about how far we would need to go if we didn't adopt a subsequent resolution at changing the procedure from here forward.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Are there Republicans who would like to speak on the floor and who want to make their feelings known about this whole case. Is that part of the dispute?</p><p>LEE: Look anytime you've got politicians, Republicans or Democrats, they're going to want to make a statement on the floor. But from the Republican senators I've talked to, they're not really that concerned about necessarily having to do that. And if it were an option, they would probably be just as happy debating on through tonight and through the weekend. It's not clear yet what will get enough votes in order for that to pass.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, does it look like this is going to hang through the State of the Union at this point and will it have any impact on the State of the Union that you can tell?</p><p>LEE: It's a definite possibility that it will hang through the State of the Union. We can't rule it out. And there are enough procedural tools at the Democrat's disposal that they could choose to make it go that far if they wanted to. The question becomes what we do about that and that's what remains to be seen. I stepped out of a meeting moments ago with my colleagues where this is being discussed. I wish I could give you a more up to date analysis on that.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, I just have one more question for you with regard to a sort of separate topic which has to do with John Bolton and his book and the information that has been coming out. So, the book is still under review as I understand it with the NSC and the White House. So, how could it be that some of it is coming out. If it's under review and what are the legal implications of the people along the way who have already seen the book if indeed there might be some reservations or classified or classified information that might be in the book.</p><p>LEE: Look if there's classified information in the book, which we have every reason to believe might well be the case, because of the fact that it's under review and if they have disclosed that to a third party there could be some very significant implications for whoever leaked it. That would be a problem. Now I don't know whether that would be John Bolton himself, whether it would be somebody connected to his author. I really have no idea, but if there's classified material in there and particularly if it's classified at the top-secret level that would be a problem.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Senator Lee, thank you very much. I know you guys are very busy, all the senators at this point in the evening and do you think is it fair to say that both sides would like to wrap it up soon or - and how many people do you think really wanted to drag on?</p><p>LEE: I don't think there are that many people who want to drag on. I mean look you've got different reasons on both sides. You've got Republicans who want to get the acquittal behind the President because we feel that he deserves it. You've got Democrats, many of whom are campaigning for President who'd like to get out of here and get to Iowa. I don't think there are a whole lot of people who want this to drag on for a long time. But we'll see what happens.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Senator Mike Lee of Utah, thank you very much. Good to see you, Senator.</p><p>LEE: Good to see you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, we are seeing a bit of movement here, but I also spoke with Democratic Senator Bob Casey from Pennsylvania during their break. And here's our conversation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: A lot going on the Hill tonight. So, tell us where it all stands as far as you can tell and when to expect a vote.</p><p>SEN. BOB CASEY (D-PA): Well, we'll know in a few minutes where things stand. I think both leaders will come out and be able to tell us where we are. But I think the procedural posture of where we are right now is, I think less important in terms rather than where we are in terms of the big issue today. And that was witnesses and documents.</p><p>I thought that the best way for the Senate to proceed was to have relevant witnesses called, relevant documents part of the record because that's the only way to have a full and fair trial. But we now know that that's not going to happen. I think that's not good for the Senate. I think the country is seeing every day now disclosures that bear on the fundamental issues of this trial. So, we'll have to go forward. But I'm not at all happy about where we are.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, what do you say to those who say look on the House side only the Democrats got to call witnesses, they called 17 witnesses, there were no Republican witnesses called and that the time for that part of this was then on the House side and that the Senate is to evaluate the case and to vote on it.</p><p>CASEY: Well, I think the only thing contrary to that or the fundamental contrary argument to that is every Senate trial whether a judge or of a president in American history has had witnesses, it just makes sense that when you have a trial you have witnesses. Now I think on the House there was also opportunities not just for witnesses to appear and witnesses to be called, but both sides got to question.</p><p>So, in a sense, they had a grand jury process which is what the impeachment process is House. But when you come to the Senate, it's a different process. And the gravity of this proceeding in large measure increases, because the determination you have to make about guilt or innocence involves removal. So, you'd want to make sure that you have every possible piece of evidence or at least reasonably possible piece of evidence on the record.</p><p>So, that I think the American people would be better off hearing from John Bolton because you have a basic issue of fact here. You have a dispute. John Bolton says one thing about his interactions and the President says another.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Very true, and is going to play out one way or the other as we watch all of this. Thank you very much, Senator Casey. Thanks for stopping by tonight.</p><p>CASEY: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Well, it looks like we're going to hear from John Bolton one way or the other. We're going to talk to the White House about that in just a moment. Stay with us. Chad. Pergram has his hands on the actual resolution that they're about to vote on. He will explain it to us when we come back. Plus, the White House as I said is going to respond to the latest revelations and we'll take a quick break. We'll be right back after this.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, senators moving back into the chamber now. You can see that the Chief Justice is back in place as well, as we continue to kind of gauge. So, let's just bring in Chad Pergram from a moment and then we may have to hop out of that if they begin. But Chad tell us what you know at this point?</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well right now Mitch McConnell has just proposed the final framework for this trial. There's going to be a vote on that here shortly and then probably votes on four or five other Democratic proposals. But this is the course of action for the next couple of days. They will have these procedural votes to set up the final landing strip for this Senate trial over the next couple of days.</p><p>The Senate will be dark over the weekend. No Senate trial tomorrow even though the Senate rules for impeachment require a Saturday session. They will come back on Monday at 11 o'clock in the morning and that's when they will move to the final arguments by the House Democratic impeachment managers and the defense counsel up to four hours on that and then senators can also make their closing arguments on this as well during the day on Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>And then you will have State of the Union of course Tuesday and then in the resolution 4 o'clock. Let's listen.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Here's Senator McConnell. Let's listen.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF JUSTICE: Is there objection. Without objection so ordered. The Democratic leader is recognized.</p><p>SCHUMER: Mr. Chief Justice I have a parliamentary inquiry.</p><p>ROBERTS: The Democratic leader will state the inquiry.</p><p>SCHUMER: Is the Chief Justice aware that in the impeachment trial of President Johnson Chief Justice Chase as presiding officer cast tie breaking votes on both March 31st and April 2nd, 1868.</p><p>ROBERTS: I am Mr. Leader, the one concerned motion to adjourn. The other concerned a motion to close deliberations. I do not regard those isolated episodes, 150 years ago as sufficient to support a general authority to break ties.</p><p>If the members of this body elected by the people and accountable to them divide equally on a motion, the normal rule is that the motion fails. I think it would be inappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government to assert the power to change that result so that the motion would succeed.</p><p>SCHUMER: Mr. Chief Justice, I send an amendment to the desk to subpoena Mulvaney, Bolton, Duffy, Blair and the White House OMB, DOD and State Department documents. And I ask that it'd be read.</p><p>ROBERTS: The clerk will report.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Senator from New York Mr. Schumer proposes an amendment number 1295. At the appropriate place of the matter following the resolving clause, insert the following. Section notwithstanding any other provision of this--</p><p>SCHUMER: The amendment be considered as read.</p><p>ROBERTS: Objection, so ordered. The majority leader is recognized--</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (D-KY): I move the table, amendment, ayes and nays.</p><p>ROBERTS: Is there a sufficient second? There is. The clerk will call the roll.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Alexander. Ms. Baldwin. Ms. Baldwin, No. Mr. Barrasso. Mr. Barrasso, Aye. Mr. Bennett. Mr. Bennett, No. Mrs. Blackburn. Mrs. Blackburn, Aye. Mr. Blumenthal. Mr. Blumenthal, No. Mr. Blunt. Mr. Blunt, Aye. Mr. Booker. Mr. Booker, No.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. So, we're listening. You're going to hear all 100 senators voting right now. And this is a vote to table the motion that was brought up by Senator Schumer which asked to summon, a subpoena to summons, Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Blair, Mr. Duffy, the White House and the OMB. We're going to obviously come back to this live, but they're going through the 100 senators at this moment. I have Hogan Gidley, the White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary alongside here. Hogan, your reaction to how this is playing out right now and Senator Schumer's proposal there.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Well, look obviously I'm not there, I've been over at the Senate pretty much the entire day watching this thing unfold and it looks like another desperate attempt by the Democrats to try and change the outcome and try and sully a process that was tainted so badly in the House and now the Senate is actually giving us a fair shake, a fair trial.</p><p>And he and the rest the Democrats are probably upset at the fact they didn't get witnesses in the Senate which is a ridiculous premise because they had 17 in the House. They could have subpoenaed John Bolton. They didn't. They had a chance to do more. They didn't. They had to rush through because they said it was in the urgency, because of the national security concerns they had about this President.</p><p>MACCALLUM: They would say obviously that John Bolton, there's been new information since that point. And also, since that point, he has said that he would be willing to come in and testify. So that's a new set of circumstances that didn't exist then.</p><p>GIDLEY: Right. But what's not new is the fact that Adam Schiff also said John Bolton had no credibility and he was just looking for a new job. So, it's pretty rich for Adam Schiff to use this as some type of ploy to try and pull in John Bolton when he himself has discredit him on many occasions. And look that follows a pattern. Anyone in Donald Trump's orbit, they hate and if they get out and say one negative thing about the President, all of a sudden, they're the toast of the town.</p><p>Adam Schiff has no credibility whatsoever. He's been caught lying about Russia collusion evidence he didn't have, about his staff talking to a whistleblower. He said they didn't, they did. He made up his entire speech to the American people and to his colleagues in Congress when he tried to pass off his own deranged demented words. Is that of the President's. I mean this guy has zero credibility on this topic whatsoever.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, it appears that there are Republicans who also want to sort of have their moment on the floor to speak their mind on how they feel about all of this and we know that there were obviously some of them wanted witnesses. Susan Collins wanted witnesses. Mitt Romney wanted witnesses and ultimately Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee both decided to vote against that.</p><p>However, Lamar Alexander said that he felt that the President's phone call was inappropriate and spoke out about it. So, it may be that some of them want that opportunity to say that on the Senate floor. What's your reaction to that?</p><p>GIDLEY: Well, I'm not going to get in trying to get to the head of the senators. I mean they have their own constituents to answer to. But the fundamental facts haven't changed here. We're not going to have witnesses in the Senate because this is supposed to be done in the house and it was. Now they don't like the way they did it. They have no one to blame but themselves.</p><p>As we move into the Senate, it's a completely different set of circumstances and as we've said many times had they decided to vote for witnesses then we can have some witnesses. But even Adam Schiff made the point yesterday, we can do this in a week. Let's just do this in a week.</p><p>So, let me get this straight. You guys had three months to do it in the House, do it the way you wanted. You completely colored the jury. You did it behind closed doors and now you're telling us you only give us a week and only let the witnesses come forward that you want and not us, they're trying to do it all over again. The fact is they ruin this process and our defense team lo and behold finally had a chance to defend this president. And on Monday let's not forget, Democrats were saying they're never going to get the vote for witnesses, and we got it, because the facts prove, the President did nothing wrong. What he actually did do was constitutional. It was legal. It was lawful. It was on behalf of the American taxpayer.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Let me ask you about the topic came out today which was another account from John Bolton and there is a word this evening that they are not commenting on this latest report which claims that the President asked John Bolton to intervene for these investigations with President Zelensky and that Rudy Giuliani, Pat Cipollone, the defense attorney that everyone's become very familiar with now in this public forum, they were all in the room at the time when the President was asking this. That is what John Bolton contends.</p><p>GIDLEY: Right. And the President came out immediately and said this wasn't true. This meeting never happened.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Would that be a matter of White House Diary record. I mean wouldn't there be a record that would say whether or not they were all in the room or not in the room?</p><p>GIDLEY: Well look, let's be very clear. What's going on here is Ambassador Bolton who left the administration has a book to sell. And as you go back to Sunday evening when the first little news of this allegation broke on Monday morning. This was clearly coordinated. As it broke, the Amazon page for preorders of the book went up immediately.</p><p>A statement from his staff went up immediately. So, this has all been very planned, very coordinated. And when those statements did come out which we don't even know if they're true, these are allegations no one has seen this manuscript. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo came out and said, not true. Attorney General Barr, the DOJ not true. Mick Mulvaney said the same thing. None of this is true.</p><p>So, this has become a pattern and a track record, and I hate to say it, but it's unfortunate because Ambassador Bolton, I worked together in the White House. He and the President had a good relationship as well. But so often people try to make money off of this President's name and it appears that's what's happening again.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Well, he came out and defended all the people who spoke out from his department and he said that it was not disloyalty. He said it's actually the opposite of that their decision to speak out. So, I mean what's clear is that they have very different views of what happened in the White House. Now, my question is, we all know that after this part of this process is over and I think it seems fairly obvious at this point that there will be an acquittal and the vote is expected to take place on Wednesday at 4 o'clock.</p><p>These questions are going to continue to go on and on and on and even to the point where you could see this issue of impeachment raised again over these same issues because there is no double jeopardy in impeachment. What do you say to that?</p><p>GIDLEY: Well look, the entire process has been political to this point. Six of the seven managers that Nancy Pelosi put in place all said they were for impeachment before this thing even started months ago. So, I think everyone knows what this is and it's a chance for Nancy Pelosi to try and put her own personal political gain and wants and desires above the needs of the American people.</p><p>This President though has done everything on behalf of the American people. He's worked hard. You see the successes. You see the gains. And that's something Democrats cannot contend with.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I just want to go back to this live, they just finished the vote. And Hogan, I'm going to ask if you can to stand by as we continue to watch this play out this evening. The motion was tabled and now we wait to see what the next motion is on the floor of the Senate this evening. So that was as I said Senator Schumer who had an amendment that he wanted to put into motion that would have had subpoenas for a number of the President's - number of White House employees including Mick Mulvaney that was immediately tabled by Speaker by Leader McConnell rather excuse me. Let's listen to this.</p><p>ROBERTS: The Ayes are 53, the nays are 47. The motion is agreed to. The Democratic leader is recognized.</p><p>SCHUMER: Mr. Chief Justice, I send an amendment to the desk to subpoena John R. Bolton and I ask that it be read.</p><p>ROBERTS: The clerk will report.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The senator from New York, Mr. Schumer proposes an amendment number 1296 at the appropriate place in the resolving clause insert the following. Section, notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution pursuant to rules 5 and 6 that the rules of procedure and practice in the Senate when sitting on impeachment trials. The Chief Justice of the United States, the Secretary of the Senate shall issue a subpoena for the taking of testimony of John Robert Bolton and the sergeant at arms is authorized to utilize the services that the deputy sergeant at arms or any other employee of the Senate and serving the subpoena authorized to be issued by this section.</p><p>ROBERTS: The Majority Leader is recognized.</p><p>MCCONNELL: I move to table the amendment, ayes and nays.</p><p>ROBERTS: Is there a sufficient second? There is. The clerk will call the roll.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Alexander, Aye.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right, so you get the idea here. This is probably the way this is going to go for quite some time this evening. There were requests for subpoena there for John Bolton, the move by Leader McConnell to table that. And now you're going to hear the roll call for the course of this.</p><p>I do want to bring in Chad Pergram one more time because there was an interesting exchange a moment ago with regard to the request establishing on Senator Schumer's part, the history of impeachment and that Salmon Chase, the Chief Justice who presided over President Johnson's impeachment did in fact choose in two out of three cases to get involved and to break a tie. Chad, give us some sense of that question? Why it was brought up at this point and the answer that was given by the Chief Justice?</p><p>PERGRAM: Well, Chuck Schumer in the past several days has talked about trying to get Chief Justice John Roberts to weigh in and rule may be in favor of witnesses or break ties in a Senate trial. Now if you notice that this was kind of prescriptive. If you're the Senate Minority Leader and you have the Chief Justice presiding over an impeachment trial, you're not going to try to trip him up.</p><p>So, a lot of times what happens in the Senate when you have a parliamentary inquiry that's where you're asking the status of what's actually going on, on the floor and you pose that from the floor to whoever is presiding, in this case John Roberts. You ask basically why can't you rule on this, why can't you interject yourself.</p><p>And if you noticed Elizabeth McDonough, the Senate parliamentarian, she had a piece of paper that had obviously been prescriptive for Chief Justice Roberts to read because they had worked this out ahead of time. And what he said was the following. He said, I do not have - first of all, I view those episodes with Chief Justice Chase and Andrew Johnson trial in 1868 as ""isolated episodes."" He noted that two of them were procedural, one was a motion to adjourn and he said, as such, I do not believe that I have sufficient authorities to break ties in the Senate.</p><p>So, what was happening there was Schumer was just trying to get the Chief Justice on the record and understand what the interpretation was because again you know you're into some pretty interesting parliamentary and constitutional turf when it comes to breaking ties. And if you look at the Senate impeachment rules, it says that the power of the Vice President will have ""devolved"" when you're dealing with impeachment trials, meaning that under Article 1 Section 3 of the Constitution, Vice Presidents can break ties, but not in a presidential impeachment trial, because the Chief Justice is presiding.</p><p>And what is an unanswered question dating back to the precedent set by Chief Justice Chase in 1868 is can the Chief Justice acting as the presiding officer break ties. And again, the other issue here is sometimes you want the tie to go a certain way, because by rule in the Senate, a tie loses.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Chad, thank you very much. We're going to continue to dig into this. It's actually very interesting. It's a great lesson I think for everybody watching this in terms of how all of this plays out. And while this is taking place on the Hill. There's another big story that's unfolding. A major shakeup igniting outrage among some of the 2020 candidates, but not Mike Bloomberg who is going to get to beyond the debate stage. There's a big development today. Chris Stirewalt on that. Stay with us.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Mostly buried by tonight's impeachment news, a major announcement from the DNC. It plans to eliminate the donor threshold requirement ahead of the February 19th debate. So, what that means is that billionaire Michael Bloomberg who has not qualified for any debates so far will now be allowed on the debate stage.</p><p>One candidate particularly irked by this is Bernie Sanders whose campaign released this statement today to quote, ""To now change the rules in the middle of the game to accommodate Mike Bloomberg who is trying to buy his way into the Democratic nomination is wrong. That's the definition of a rigged system.""</p><p>Joining me now Chris Stirewalt, Fox News politics editor. So, Bernie is feeling like the system is rigged against him again and you know, they did change the rules midstream here, Chris. What do you think?</p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR: Well, wait a minute, they said that they would have different rules for each debate. And as they've gone on, they've changed the rules as they've gone on to change this threshold or that threshold.</p><p>The part that I find funny Bernie Sanders surrogates as recently as this week were complaining about the fact that Mike Bloomberg wasn't in the debates. How come he is getting a free ride. He needs the full spectrum treatment. He's got to stay and toe to toe with these people.</p><p>And then he gets in or he might get in the debate and all of a sudden, it's a rigged system. So, guess what? His opponents are never going to be pleased with anything that he does. The question now is this good for Bloomberg? How does this affect Joe Biden and how does this affect the race?</p><p>MACCALLUM: And what does it say about the DNC? I would have loved to be a fly on the wall when they were deciding whether or not they are going to change these rules. Are they concerned about these candidates and do they feel like it will benefit them to sort of get him in the mix?</p><p>STIREWALT: So, you got 900 or so Democratic National Committee members and that is Tom Perez's their chairman. That's his real constituency. What do those folks want? How do they want it? How do they think this is going?</p><p>They are under pressure right now as a matter of fact to maybe change the rules at the convention so that the super delegates, those unpledged delegates members of Congress and other party leaders get a vote on the first ballot. because everybody is worried about, what? Bernie Sanders becoming the Democratic nominee.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, it's crazy. Because that's what did was last time.</p><p>STIREWALT: Right.</p><p>MACCALLUM: And Hillary got those super delegates, she had so many of them locked up before they even got to the convention. And Bernie and his folks they never forget it, you know, turning around with their backs to Hillary Clinton all around that entire stadium that night.</p><p>So, I mean, he's got to feel. If you are Bernie Sanders you do feel like this thing is rigged against you.</p><p>STIREWALT: Well, it's also --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Or that everyone is out to get you.</p><p>STIREWALT: It's also a great sales pitch. Right? Because if what you are selling if you are leading a populist insurrection everything -- you just have a hot tea. Blank is evidence of a system rigged against us, blank is evidence of a system rigged against us. It works. You raise money. You get people upset.</p><p>But remember, when Bernie Sanders got to the convention last time, he couldn't have won even without the super delegates on Hillary Clinton's side. He is afraid that the same thing is going to happen this time. He's going to get into the home stretch against a more centrist Democratic candidate and get squeezed out.</p><p>MACCALLUM: He's got -- I mean, there is certainly a lot being written and said and reported on that Democrats are concerned with this strength that he has.</p><p>Here is the latest poll. This is the first national poll that puts Bernie Sanders in the first -- in first place here 27 to 26. It's basically a dead heat. Warren at 15 percent. One of -- Bloomberg is in fourth in this poll. And he has been, you know, getting some upward traction. We'll see if he can -- he can continue that.</p><p>One of the things that I find fascinating is something that we discussed briefly today is that Joe Biden has been in Iowa and he is declining. And the senators who have been in Washington, Amy Klobuchar and Bernie Sanders have been going up while they have been stuck here.</p><p>STIREWALT: Well, Biden hasn't been declining but he has been treading water. It is true that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: And other people are gaining some traction.</p><p>STIREWALT: And other people are gaining some traction. That's true. The question for Biden now is, as Bloomberg looks viable what does that do to Joe Biden. It increases the pressure on Biden to have a really bloom (Ph) February and win two or three of the four contests in February because Michael Bloomberg is out there squatting on super Tuesday. He is waiting for him.</p><p>And he has already spent something like a quarter of a billion dollars on television ads. That is a lot of money. And if Biden doesn't go into super Tuesday strong, he can find himself delegate hobbled and unable to win decisively in Milwaukee whatever Bernie Sanders does.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Let's take a quick look this Super Bowl ads. Because the billionaires are going to be head to head buying their Super Bowl ads on Sunday. Here is the Bloomberg part of it, his, and part of the president's. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The child that I gave birth to is no longer here. Lives are being lost every day. It is a national crisis. I heard Mike Bloomberg speak. He has been in this fight for so long.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: America demanded change.</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, HOST, CNN: Donald Trump wins the presidency.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And change is what we got. Under President Trump America is stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Got a big audience for those on Sunday.</p><p>STIREWALT: Huge audience and both positive ads. Right? Bloomberg is there trying to stick to his brand on gun control with Democrats and the president with his best message, Donald Trump's best message the thing that will work for him that has worked for incumbent presidents before, we're at peace and the economy is good. Peace and prosperity sell pretty well as it turns out.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, Chris Stirewalt, you have a plane to catch.</p><p>STIREWALT: Right now, Iowa awaits.</p><p>MACCALLUM: We're going to let you get out of here. We hope you make it. And we'll see you there tomorrow, Chris. Always great to see you, thank you.</p><p>STIREWALT: You bet.</p><p>MACCALLUM: More of The Story coming up next.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, in other news a very big story going on. The United States declaring a public health emergency today in response to the coronavirus with at least seven confirmed cases now in the United States and a couple of others that are not confirmed at this point.</p><p>President Trump also restricting entry for foreign nationals who recently visited China.</p><p>Jeff Paul is live in our west coast newsroom with the story tonight. Hi, Jeff.</p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Martha. We are learning tonight that President Trump as you said has signed an order for new travel restrictions. Starting at 5 p.m. Eastern on Sunday the U.S. will temporarily ban foreign nationals who pose a risk of transmitting the coronavirus from entering the country.</p><p>Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also announcing any U.S. citizen who has traveled to the Hubei province in the last two weeks must undergo 14 days of mandatory quarantine upon returning to the U.S.</p><p>Those who are coming back from the rest of mainland China in the same time period will be screened at ports of entry and undergo 14 days of self- monitoring. Also beginning on Sunday, all flights to the U.S. from China will be directed to just seven airports so passengers can be screened for the illness.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX AZAR, SECRETARY, UNITED STATES HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: I want to stress, the risk of infection for Americans remain low and with these and our previous actions, we are working to keep the risk low.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL: In the span of two months the virus has infected around 10,000 people worldwide. More than 200 people have died and so far, all the deaths have occurred in China.</p><p>In the U.S., a seventh case was confirmed in Santa Clara County, California, the third such case in the state. Health officials there say while the flu has been far more devastating in the United States, people are more afraid of the coronavirus because there is so much unknown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARA CODY, HEALTH OFFICER, SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA: It's novel, it's new, there's a lot that we don't know. And so, I want to acknowledge that people feel rightly concerned because it's new.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL: The CDC has also confirmed a case in Washington State, one in Arizona, and two in Illinois. Martha?</p><p>MACCALLUM: Jeff Paul, thank you very much.</p><p>So, if President Trump is acquitted in this impeachment trial, which it appears he will be, some Democrats are already calling the verdict illegitimate.</p><p>Guy Benson and Richard Fowler are here on that, coming up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have a trial without relevant witnesses and documents, that it's a sham. And there is no vindication in a fraudulent trial.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: There is so much going on right now in so many places and also in other news, Brexit is now official. Think about how long it took for this to come to reality.</p><p>Less than two hours ago, the United Kingdom officially exited the European Union. It had been a member for 47 years. It comes more than three and a half years after the historic Brexit vote finally implemented. Here is British Prime Minister Boris Johnson just a short time ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: The most important thing to say tonight is that this is not an end but a beginning. This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain go up on a new act in our great national drama.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Pretty remarkable when you think about how hard it was for Theresa May and Boris Johnson got it done. Now Britain enters the so-called transition period. They have until December 31st to hammer out the details like setting up trade deals with the remaining European Union countries and the United States which could get a little sticky but they are on their way.</p><p>So more than 28,000 pages of evidence, 22 hours of opening statements from House managers and nearly 200 questions asked by senators during the trial, but Senate Democrats led by Chuck Schumer are now saying that this process is illegitimate in terms of the trial as they brace for an acquittal which is expected to happen on Wednesday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: The president's acquittal will be meaningless because it will be the result of a sham trial. If there are no witnesses, no documents in this trial, there will be a permanent asterisk next to the acquittal of President Trump written in permanent ink.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Here now Guy Benson, host of the Guy Benson show, and Richard Fowler, nationally syndicated radio show host, and both are Fox News contributors.</p><p>So, Richard, I guess, you know, obviously, it all depends on where you come down on this. But I think probably a lot of folks who have watched this whole thing feel like enough is enough.</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I think the American people are weary of impeachment --</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes.</p><p>FOWLER: -- whether you are a Democrat because you think it was a forgone conclusion that from the beginning of this trial it was going to fall along party lines or you're a Republican who feels as though the president did nothing wrong and it was a, quote, unquote, ""perfect call.""</p><p>I think with that being said, what makes this case very interesting to me, is that once this acquittal happens two months from now we'll all have a copy of the John Bolton book and if there are actual revelations in there Republicans will have some explaining to do why they didn't allow him as a witness, why didn't they discover this evidence because the American people will be able to read it.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Guy?</p><p>GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: First of all, happy birthday, Martha.</p><p>MACCALLUM: No.</p><p>BENSON: It's so good to be here.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p><p>BENSON: Look, I'm in the interesting position where I'm against impeachment and removal. I think that's the wrong remedy. I think the president did do something inappropriate here. And I would have voted with Senator Collins and Senator Romney to hear from John Bolton because the counter arguments are completely fair and they are actually quite compelling.</p><p>I think getting that piece of information outweighs those concerns. But I'm also very sympathetic to the many senators who had no appetite for this notion that the House of Representatives, the Democrats control it, it was their job to build the best, most thorough case that they could.</p><p>Instead they did a shoddy, shabby rush job and now they want the Senate to do sort of a cleanup job for them --</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes.</p><p>BENSON: -- at the end and I can understand why a lot of Republicans said if we want to talk about shams, there is a lot of sham to go around in Washington on this whole process.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You know, what strikes me is that from the beginning it was always going to be a completely partisan process because when we've watched this before, you think about even the Mueller investigation. You know, there was an outside counsel who was appointed. Robert Mueller did an investigation and for those years when that was going on both sides sort of said well, you know, we'll see what he says when it comes back.</p><p>But in this situation, it was led by Chairman Schiff. It went into the intel committee. Not the judiciary committee. So, it feels as if it was so dug in that that this was never going to be something that was going to get buy-in on both sides.</p><p>So, in that situation, Richard, when it does get to the Senate it's their House. The Republicans have the majority. They are saying, you know what? Once you left it from the -- let it go from the House, it did become our process and we are not going to, you know, help you find the president guilty in this case.</p><p>FOWLER: I get that argument. I'm very sympathetic to it. I think what makes this case so interesting is that last night, and I think Adam Schiff said and I think it was a moment that I remembered in the trial because I think it was stark and telling was, he's like, as we are sitting here talking about impeachment, the Justice Department is at the court arguing if the remedy for the president on abiding by subpoenas is impeachment. Right?</p><p>And so, I think that has been the Democratic case all along. That case did not -- did not pick up any Republican votes. Like Guy was in the Senate to vote with us and Guy will take a look but he was not.</p><p>And so now we sit in a place where this president will be acquitted but this Ukraine thing still looms over his presidency. I think now the question will be how will Republicans operate and how will this president operate?</p><p>MACCALLUM: I think the story doesn't -- the story does not die. We all know that because John Bolton is going to keep talking about it. His book is going to come out. It's going to continue to live in the world of media and everywhere else and be on people's lips, Guy.</p><p>BENSON: Yes.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, it goes on and on and on.</p><p>BENSON: There's going to be an acquittal. The acquittal is going to count. Chuck Schumer can talk about asterisks as long as he wants. It's a real acquittal. Vindication is a separate question. Right? We can debate whether there is vindication here. But I do think there is a certain exhaustion.</p><p>We have gone through, what, three years of the Russia thing that went nowhere. And now we are on to Ukraine. I think it's interesting to see senators like Rubio and Lamar Alexander saying OK, I think the president did some things here that were inappropriate, it is not correct, therefore, afterwards to use our position in the Senate to uproot a duly elected president from the presidency with voters going to the polls in about nine months.</p><p>And I think a lot of people, you know, look, they could have gotten every witness that they wanted. The result of this trial was going to be almost exactly the same give or take two, maybe three votes.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, --</p><p>BENSON: They are not going to come close to 67.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Even if you look at, you have you John Kelly who came out and he said that he believes John Bolton, he was chief of staff at the White House, of course, for a time. And then he said in my view they kind of lead themselves open to a lot of criticism. It seems it was half a trial.</p><p>But what have you, Richard, is that, you know, the White House didn't say that wasn't said at that meeting. What he is saying is not true. John Bolton says it is true. And I just wonder when you go down this road, you know, whether you are ever going to get any sort of conclusive agreement on what happened.</p><p>FOWLER: And I think that's part of the problem as Republicans. And I think Guy brings up an interesting point. While Guy and other Republicans have been very outlet this call was not perfect. There was a lot wrong with it. We don't hear -- I think this would have went away a lot quicker if there were more Republicans who came out and said, Mr. President, your behavior on this call was unbecoming. It was unpresidential.</p><p>And to be frank with you, the reason why this impeachment is happening because there are some parts of these calls and part of this whole operation that raise questions to the American people. That what miss -- what was missing here is Republicans never did that and now as we get into this election, right, which literally starts on Monday.</p><p>BENSON: Some did.</p><p>FOWLER: Some did. Leaders there. But I think there should have been more --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BENSON: Yes, a number of them --</p><p>FOWLER: -- Republicans. So, I think anybody who understands foreign policy understands how incorrect his behavior was.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I think that credo came from the top and the president's attorneys were, you know --</p><p>BENSON: That's right.</p><p>MACCALLUM: -- he did nothing wrong. That was line and there are people who obviously disagree with that and think that the call wasn't perfect.</p><p>Let's go down and listen to Leader McConnell. Thanks, gentlemen. Stand by, if you will. Let's hear what he has to say.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER: Either given or submitted during the legislative sessions of the Senate on Monday, February 3rd, Tuesday, February 4th, and Wednesday, February 5th. Along with the full record of the Senate's proceedings and the filings by the parties in a Senate document printed under the supervision of the secretary of the Senate that will complete the documentation of the Senate's handling of these impeachment proceedings.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES: Without objection, so ordered.</p><p>MCCONNELL: Further, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes legislative session on Monday, February 3rd, Tuesday, February 4th, and Wednesday, February 5th the Senate be in a period of morning business with senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each for a debate only.</p><p>ROBERTS: Without objection, so ordered.</p><p>MCCONNELL: And finally, I ask unanimous consent that the trial adjourn until 11 a.m. February 3rd.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, Mitch McConnell laying it all out, basically they have to -- let's go to Chad on this, he's standing by. Basically, they have to go into regular session, Chad, so that the State of the Union can happen on Tuesday night. Then they'll go back into the order of impeachment. The court of impeachment. Is that right?</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right. And what they just approved there are 53-47 was the vote approving the final trial framework for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday setting up the final arguments by the House Democratic impeachment managers on Monday, and also for the defense on Monday as well.</p><p>And then senators, you know, that was one of the big issues here, they wanted to have their say on the floor. They will get those opportunities, you know, on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday during regular session. That will kind of be outside the parameters of this final trial framework.</p><p>And then of course 4 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon. That's when we will have two separate votes rendering verdict on the President of the United States on the two articles of impeachment, two separate votes. And in the impeachment rules, the senators rise from their desk and they vote guilty or not guilty. Again, a reminder it takes 67 votes, two thirds to convict and remove, Martha.</p><p>MACCALLUM: What a journey. All leading to Wednesday when we will see that vote. Chad Pergram, thank you so much. Great coverage throughout the day. Thank you everybody at home for being with us on The Story tonight as we watch this dramatic historic several days play out. And we head into -- tomorrow is off.

They called him.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">If we have witnesses, we have the right to call that witness and to cross- examine Deputy Assistant...</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: All right, everybody, I'm Neil Cavuto.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">You're watching a special ""Your World.""</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">We are in right now Iowa for the big caucuses 48 hours for now, but we briefly interrupting this hearing to alert you to a major sell-off at the corner of Wall and Broad, the Dow Jones industrials skidding better than 610 points.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">We are getting word right now that this coronavirus situation is going from bad to worse. The Trump administration has just imposed across-the-board travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines over this coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>U.S. airlines, including American, United and Delta, have halted, if not dramatically cut back, flights to and from the region. Concerns of a slowdown gripping much of Asia that has battered all the Asian markets and taking attention away from what has otherwise been a positive month of January, but on this last trading day of the month, the Dow entered negative territory.</p><p>And so did the S&amp;P 500, amid growing concerns of that China's flu has turned into the world's cold.</p><p>Now back to the hearing.</p><p>SEKULOW: There were other witnesses that were called or you saw their testimony or heard their testimony, or it was referred to, Catherine Croft, the special adviser for Ukraine negotiations, Department of the State, Mark Sandy, the deputy associate director for national security programs, and Christopher Anderson, special adviser for Ukraine negotiation Department of State.</p><p>You heard their testimony referred to. We did not have the opportunity to cross-examine them. So this isn't going to happen if witnesses are called in a week.</p><p>Now, that's just the witnesses that have been produced that you have seen by the House managers. You are being called upon to make consequential constitutional decisions, consequential decisions for our Constitution.</p><p>We talk about the burden of proof. I have said this before. I will say it again; 31 times, the managers said they proved their case; 29 times, they said the evidence was overwhelming. Manager Nadler, he didn't only say it was overwhelming, in his view.</p><p>On page 739 of the congressional record, he's very clear. He says, not only is it strong. There is no doubt. That's what he says. The one thing that the House managers think the president counsels' got right is quoting me, talking about Mr. Nadler, manager Nadler, as saying, beyond any doubt, it is indeed beyond any doubt.</p><p>Now, of course, we think that they have not proven their case, by any stretch of any proper constitutional analysis.</p><p>In the Clinton investigation, they talk about witnesses being called, but the three witnesses that were called had either testified before the grand jury or before the House committees. These weren't new witnesses.</p><p>What Mr. Philbin said is correct. Under our constitutional design, they're supposed to investigate. You are to deliberate. But what they're asking you to do is now become the investigative agency, the investigative body.</p><p>If they needed all this additional evidence, which they said they don't need -- and, by the way, not only did they say it in the record. This is House manager Nadler -- quote -- it's on -- when he was on CNN, back on the 15th of this month.</p><p>""We brought the articles of impeachment, because, despite the fact that we didn't hear from many witnesses we could have heard from, we heard from enough witnesses to prove the case beyond any doubt at all.""</p><p>The same can we said of Representative Lofgren. ""You know, we have had -- we have evidence proving the case through, for example, at the meeting when Bolton said it was a drug deal. Well, we have fact witnesses. Hill was there. Vindman was there. Sondland was there.""</p><p>So this idea that they haven't had witnesses is -- that's the smokescreen. You have heard from a lot of witnesses. The problem with the case, the problem with their position is, even with all of those witnesses, it doesn't prove up an impeachable offense.</p><p>The articles fail. I think it's very dangerous if the House runs up, which they did, articles of impeachment quickly, so quickly that they are clamoring for evidence, despite the fact that they put all of this evidence forward.</p><p>They got their wish of an impeachment by Christmas. That was the goal. But now they want you to do the work they failed to do.</p><p>But, as I said, time and time again, we heard, you didn't hear from witnesses. You didn't hear from many witnesses. Mr. Schiff modify that a little bit today, a little bit.</p><p>You heard from a lot of witnesses. But if we go down the road of witnesses, this is not a one-week process. Remember, I talked about the waving the wand in the Ukraine corruption, Ukraine was gone. You're not going to have a witness wand here, where we just say, OK, you got a week to do this and get it done.</p><p>There's no way that would be proper under due process. But due process is supposed to be for the person accused. And they're turning it on its head. They brought the articles before you. They're the ones that rushed the case up and then held it before you could actually start the proceedings, but they're the ones that passed the articles before Christmas.</p><p>You know, we talked a lot about the court system and the fact that they were seeking witnesses. And when they got close to actually having a court proceeding, they decided that they didn't want to have that witness go through that proceeding. They actually withdrew the subpoena to move the case out.</p><p>How many constitutional challenges will we have in this body because they placed a burden on you that they wouldn't take themselves in putting their case forward?</p><p>If we look at our constitutional framework and our constitutional structure, that's not the way it supposed to work.</p><p>Now, our opposition to this motion is rather straightforward, as I have said. We came here ready to try the case on the record that they presented, the record that the managers told us was overwhelming and complete.</p><p>Mr. Schiff went through every sentence of the articles impeachment just a few days ago and said, proved, proved, proved. The problem is, what it proved, proved, proved is not an impeachable offense.</p><p>You could -- you could have witnesses that prove a lot of things, but if there's not a violation of a law, if it doesn't meet the constitutional required process, the constitutionally required substantive issues of, do these articles, these allegations rise to the level of a -- sufficient for a removal of office for a duly elected president of the United States?</p><p>It doesn't, and especially so, especially so when we are in an election year.</p><p>I am not going to take the time, your time, which is precious, to go over and each and every allegation about witnesses that I could. I could do it. I could stand here for a long time. I'm not going to do that.</p><p>I'm just going to say this. They created the record. Do not allow them to penalize the country and the Constitution because they failed to do their job.</p><p>With that, Mr. Chief Justice, we yield our time.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT: Thank you, counsel.</p><p>The House managers have 30 minutes remaining.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Senators.</p><p>I want to walk through some of the arguments that you have just heard from the president's counsel.</p><p>The first were arguments made by Mr. Philbin.</p><p>Mr. Philbin began by saying, the House managers assert that you can't have a trial without witnesses. And he said, it's not that simple.</p><p>Actually, it is. It is pretty simple. It is pretty simple. In every courthouse, in every state, in every county in the country, where they have trials, they have witnesses.</p><p>And I think you heard Mr. Philbin tie himself into knots as to why this should be the first trial in which witnesses are not necessary.</p><p>But some things are just as simple as they appear. A trial without witnesses is simply not a trial. You can call it something else, but it's not a trial.</p><p>Now, Mr. Sekulow said something very interesting. He said, the House investigates, and the Senate deliberates.</p><p>Well, he would rewrite our Constitution with that argument, because the last time I checked the Constitution, it said that the House shall have the sole power of impeachment, and the Senate shall try the impeachment, not merely deliberate about it, not merely think about it, not merely wonder about it.</p><p>I know you're the greatest deliberative body in the world, but not even you can deliberate in a trial without witnesses.</p><p>But Mr. Sekulow would rewrite the Constitution. Your job is not to try the case, he says. Your job is merely to deliberate.</p><p>That is not what the founders had in mind, not by a long shot.</p><p>Now, Mr. Philbin says, none of these witnesses would have relevance on article two, I guess conceding that they would have relevant evidence on article one.</p><p>But that's not true either.</p><p>Imagine what you will see when you hear from the witnesses who ran the Office of Management and Budget. Or imagine what you will see when you read the documents from the Office of Management and Budget.</p><p>What you will see is what they have covered up. What you will see is the motive for their complete obstruction of Congress, when you see not the redacted e-mails, not the fully blacked-out e-mails that they deign to give in the litigation under the Freedom of Information Act, but when you see what is under those redactions.</p><p>You will have proof motive. When you see those documents, you will see just how fallacious these non-assertions of executive privilege are. You will see, in essence, what they have covered up. It could not be more relevant to whether their panoply of legal argumentation to justify, we shall fight all subpoenas, is merely a cover-up and legal window dressing.</p><p>So these witnesses and documents are critical on both articles.</p><p>Now, you also heard Mr. Philbin argue -- and, again, this is where we expected we would be at the end of the proceeding, which is, essentially, they proved their case. They proved their case.</p><p>We pretty much all know what's gone on here. We all understand just what this president did. No one really disputes that anymore.</p><p>So what? So what?</p><p>It's a version of the Dershowitz defense. So what? The president can do no wrong. The president is the state. If the president believes that corrupt conduct would help him get reelected, if he believes shaking down an ally and withholding military aid, if he believes soliciting foreign interference in our election, whether it be from the Ukrainians, or the Russians, or the Israeli prime minister, or anyone else in any form that it may take, so what?</p><p>He has a God-given right to abuse his power, and there's nothing you can do about it.</p><p>It's the Dershowitz principle of constitutional lawlessness. That's -- that's the end-all argument for them. You don't need to hear witnesses who will prove the president's misconduct because he has a right to be as corrupt as he chooses, under our Constitution. And there's nothing you can do about it.</p><p>God help us if that argument succeeds.</p><p>Now, they say that these witnesses already testified, and so you don't need to hear from anybody. There were witnesses who already testifies, and so the House doesn't get to call witnesses in the Senate.</p><p>That would be like a criminal trial in any courthouse in America where the defendant, if he's rich and powerful enough, can say to the judge, hey, judge, the prosecution got to have witnesses in the grand jury. They don't get to call anyone here. They had their chance in the grand jury. They called witnesses in the grand jury. They don't get to call witnesses here.</p><p>That's not how it works in any courtroom in America. And it's not how it should work in this courtroom.</p><p>Of course, you heard the argument again, repeated time and time again, the House is saying they're not ready for trial.</p><p>Of course, we have never said we weren't ready for trial. We came here very prepared for trial.</p><p>I would submit to you, the president's team came here unprepared for trial, unprepared for the fact that there would be, as we all anticipated, a daily drip of new disclosures that would send them back on their heels.</p><p>We came here to try a case, prepared to try a case. And, yes, we had, I hope, the not unreasonable expectation that, in trying that case, like in every courtroom in America, we could call witnesses. That is not a lack of preparation. That is the presence of common sense.</p><p>They didn't try to get Bolton, they argued. Mr. Philbin said, they didn't even try to get Bolton.</p><p>Now, of course, we did try to get Bolton. And what he said when he refused to show up voluntarily is, if you subpoena me, I will sue you. I will sue you.</p><p>He said basically what Don McGahn told us nine months ago: I will sue you. Good luck with that.</p><p>Now, the public argument that was made by his counsel was that he and Dr. Kupperman, out of just due diligence, they just want a court to opine that it's OK for them to come forward and testify. As soon as the court blesses their testimony, they're more than willing to come in. They just are going to court to get a court opinion saying they could do it.</p><p>And so, of course, we said to them, if that's your real motivation, there's a court about to rule on this very issue of absolute immunity.</p><p>And, very shortly thereafter, that court did. That was the court, Judge Jackson in the McGahn case, and the judge said, this argument about absolute immunity, which, yes, presidents have always dreamed about and asserted, but which has been never succeeded in any court in the land.</p><p>It was ridiculed in the case of Harriet Miers. It was made short shrift in the case of Don McGahn, where the judge said, no, we don't have kings here. In the 250 years of jurisprudence, there is not a single case to support the proposition that the president can simply say that my advisers are absolutely immune from process.</p><p>And, of course, in every other non-impeachment context, where the courts have looked at the issue of a Congress' power to enforce its subpoenas against witnesses or documents, the courts have said, the power to compel compliance to a subpoena is co-equal, co-extensive with the power to legislate, because you can't do one without the other.</p><p>If we can't find out whether the president is breaking the law, violating the Impoundment Control Act or any other when he is withholding aid we appropriated from an ally, how can we legislate a fix to make sure that this never happens again?</p><p>We can't. If we can't get answers, we can't legislate. that is a proposition vindicated by every court in the land. And, of course, in the context of impeachment, the courts have said that is never more important, never more important.</p><p>Now, I don't know why, after saying he would sue us -- and we had to expect that, like Don McGahn, where we are still in court nine months later, I don't know why he's changed his mind.</p><p>But I suspect it's for the reason that, if this trial goes forward, and he keeps this to himself, it will be very difficult to explain to the country why he saved it for the book. When he knew information of direct relevance and consequence to a decision that you have to make about whether a president of the United States should be removed from office, it will be very difficult to explain why that was saved for a book.</p><p>Well, I would submit to you it will be equally difficult for you to explain as it would be for him, when you can ask him that question: Why are you willing to testify before the Senate, but not the House? And you should ask him that question.</p><p>Now, it was said -- and it has the character of, you should have fought harder to overcome our obstruction. The House should have fought harder to overcome our stonewalling. Shame on the House for not fighting harder to overcome our stonewalling. If only they had fought harder to overcome our stonewalling, maybe they could have gotten these witnesses earlier.</p><p>That's a really hard argument to make while they're stonewalling. You should have tried harder. You should have taken the years that would be necessary to overcome our stonewalling.</p><p>And the reason why that argument is in such bad faith, as I pointed out to you yesterday, that, while they're in this body arguing, the House was derelict, slapdash, they should have fought harder and longer and endlessly to overcome our stonewalling, while they're making that argument to you, the House should have fought up and down the courts, from the district, to the court of appeals, the Supreme Court, and back again, they're in the courthouse arguing the opposite.</p><p>They're in the courthouse saying, Judge, they're trying to enforce a subpoena on Don McGahn. You need to throw it out. They don't have the jurisdiction. This is non-justiciable. You can't hear this case.</p><p>That is a really hard argument to make. I credit them for making it with a straight face.</p><p>But that's the character of it. You should have fought harder to overcome our stonewalling and obstruction.</p><p>Now, they also say the chief justice cannot decide issues of privilege. No, the chief justice can't make those decisions. You need to let us litigate this up and down the court system.</p><p>That's a pretty remarkable argument, because the Senate rules allow the presiding officer to make judgments, to rule on issues of evidence, materiality and privilege. That is permitted under your own rules.</p><p>We don't need to go up and down the courts. We have got a perfectly good judge right here.</p><p>Now, you heard our proposal yesterday that we take a week, just a week, to depose the witnesses that we feel are relevant, that they feel are relevant, and that the justice rules are relevant, just one week.</p><p>Now, they can say that the Constitution requires them to go to court, but, of course, it doesn't. There is absolutely no constitutional impediment from these fine lawyers saying, you know, that's eminently reasonable. We will allow a neutral party, the chief justice of the United States of America, to rule on whether a witness is material or immaterial, whether they're being called for purposes of probative evidence or harassment, and whether are you a making a proper claim of privilege or merely trying to hide crime or fraud.</p><p>The concern they have is not that this chief justice will be unfair, but, rather, that he will be fair.</p><p>But do not make any mistake about it. Do not let them suggest that there is something constitutionally impermissible or it would violate the president's rights to allow the chief justice of the United States to make those decisions in this court, because he is empowered to do so by your rules and by the Constitution, which gives you the sole power to try impeachments.</p><p>In the sole exercise of your power to try impeachments, you can say, we will allow the chief justice to make those decisions.</p><p>Now, Mr. Sekulow, said that you have heard the testimony of 13 witnesses. And I think the impression is meant to be given, if not to you, who know otherwise, then maybe the people watching at home, that they must have been in between errands while watching the Senate trial and missed where those 13 witnesses came before the Senate and testified.</p><p>But, of course, you heard no live testimony in this body. There wasn't any live testimony before this body. And I don't recall any of you in that super secret basement bunker they have been talking about.</p><p>Now, I'll admit there were 100 members eligible to be there, so maybe I missed one of you. But I don't think you were there for the live testimony in the House.</p><p>Now, Mr. Sekulow says, the president was deprived of his right of calling these witnesses himself and cross-examining these witnesses in the House.</p><p>But that's not true either, because the president was eligible to call witnesses in his defense in the Judiciary Committee, and chose not to do so.</p><p>If the president's counsel felt that, you know, Bill Taylor says that he spoke with Sondland right after this phone call with the president, and Sondland talked about how the military aid was conditioned on these investigations, the president wanted Zelensky in a public box, and I'd really like to cross-examine that West Point grad, Vietnam vet, because I don't believe him, they could have called Bill Taylor in the Judiciary Committee and cross-examined him.</p><p>Or they could have called Mick Mulvaney and put him under oath and let him contradict what we now John Bolton would say.</p><p>But, of course, they didn't do that. No, they said merely, just get over -- get it over with in the House. For all their it was too quick, too slapdash, get it over with in the House, because, as the president said, when it comes to the Senate, we will have a real trial, where he gets to call witnesses.</p><p>But they have changed their tune, because now they know what they really have known all along, which is, those witnesses would deeply incriminate this president.</p><p>And so, instead, they have fallen back on the argument that, if we're going to go down the road to having a real trial, if we're going to go down the road into having a real trial, we, the president lawyers, are going to make you pay.</p><p>And the form of this argument is, we are going to call every witness under the sun. We're going to call every witness that testified before the House. We're going to call every witness that we can think of that would help smear the Bidens. We are going to keep you here until kingdom come.</p><p>That's essentially the argument that they're making, when Mr. Sekulow says, we're going to bring in Fiona Hill, and we're going to bring in Tim Morrison, we're going to bring in this witness and bring in that witness.</p><p>You have the sole power to try this case. You do not have to allow the president's lawyers to abuse your time or this process. You have the power to decide, no, we gave each side 24 hours to make their arguments. We're going to give each side a shared week to call their witnesses.</p><p>You have that power. If you didn't, you couldn't have constricted the amount of time for our argument. You can likewise determine how much time should be taken with witness testimony.</p><p>Now, Mr. Sekulow ended his argument against witnesses with where Mr. Philbin essentially began. It all comes back to the Dershowitz principle. What's the point of witnesses, if the president can do whatever he wants under Article 2?</p><p>What's the point of calling witnesses, what's the point of having a trial, if the president can do whatever he wants under Article 2? The only constraining principle -- and I think that one of the senators asked yesterday, what's the limiting principle in the Dershowitz argument?</p><p>If a president can corruptly seek foreign interference in his election because he believes that his election is in the national interest, then you cannot impeach him for it, no matter how damaging it may be to our national security. What is the limiting principle?</p><p>And I suppose the limiting principle is only this. It only requires the president to believe that his reelection is in the national interest.</p><p>Well, it would require an extraordinary level of self-reflection and insight for a president of the United States to conclude that his own reelection was not in the national interest, not unprecedented, mind you.</p><p>I think that was the decision that LBJ ultimately arrived at. But I would not want to consider that a meaningful limitation on presidential power, and neither should you.</p><p>Finally, counsel expressed some indignance, indignance that we should suggest that it's not just the Senate -- it's not just the president, rather, who is on trial here, but it is also the Senate. How dare the House managers suggest that your decisions should reflect on this body? That's just such a calumny.</p><p>Well, let me read you a statement made by one of your former colleagues.</p><p>This is what former us Senator John Warner, a Republican of Virginia, had to say.</p><p>""As conscientious citizens from all walks of life are trying their best to understand the complex impeachment issues now being deliberated in the U.S. Senate, the rules of evidence are central to the matter. Should the Senate allow additional sworn testimony from fact witnesses with firsthand knowledge and include relevant documents?"" he asks.</p><p>""As a lifelong Republican and a retired member of the U.S. Senate who once served as a juror in a presidential impeachment trial, I am mindful of the difficult responsibilities those currently serving now shoulder. I believe, as I'm sure you do, that not only is the president on trial, but, in many ways, so is the Senate itself.</p><p>""As such, I am strongly supportive of the efforts of my former Republican Senate colleagues who are considering that the Senate accept the introduction of additional evidence that they deem relevant.</p><p>""Not long ago, senators of both major parties always worked to accommodate fellow colleagues with differing points of view to arrive at outcomes that would best serve the nation's interests. I would -- if witnesses are suppressed in this trial, and a majority of Americans are left believing the trial was a sham, I can only imagine the lasting damage done to the Senate and to our fragile national consensus.</p><p>""The Senate embraces its legacy and delivers for the American people by avoiding the risk. Throughout the long life of our nation, federal and state judicial systems have largely supported the judicial norms of evidence, witnesses and relevant documents.</p><p>""I respectfully urge the Senate to be guided by the rules of evidence and follow our nation's judicial norms, precedents and institutions to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law by welcoming relevant witnesses and documents as part of this impeachment trial.""</p><p>That is your colleague former Senator John Warner.</p><p>Senators, there's a storm blowing through this Capitol. Its winds are strong, and they move us in uncertain and dangerous directions.</p><p>Jefferson once said, ""I consider trial by jury as the only anchor yet imagined by man by which a government can be held to the principles of its Constitution, the only anchor ever imagined -- yet imagined by man by which a government can be held to the principles of its Constitution.""</p><p>I would submit to you, remove that anchor and we are adrift. But if we hold true, if we have faith, that the ship of state can survive the truth, this storm shall pass.</p><p>I yield back.</p><p>ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Manager.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Mr. Chief Justice...</p><p>ROBERTS: The majority leader is recognized.</p><p>MCCONNELL: ... I suggest the absence of a quorum.</p><p>ROBERTS: The clerk will call the roll.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED CLERK: Mr. Alexander.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we are monitoring this.</p><p>I'm not quite sure what's going on here, but Matthew Whitaker, the former acting attorney general, might.</p><p>This is right after Adam Schiff's presentation here.</p><p>What are we exactly seeing here, Matthew?</p><p>MATTHEW WHITAKER, FORMER ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, what we just saw was really the argument for and against witnesses.</p><p>The Senate is moving on to considering, I'm sure, several motions this afternoon and tonight from the House -- from the Senate minority leader, Schumer. And this was the first one.</p><p>And it was a discussion about witnesses. And now the majority leader has suggested there wasn't a quorum. So we're doing that fun little quorum call that stalls for time.</p><p>But what we just heard, Neil, was really -- I think we all know how this is going to turn out. And we have talked about this before, that there's going to be a vote. We know that witnesses is going to go down 51-49.</p><p>And then, eventually, we will proceed to the acquittal of the president, which we expect that there could be several senators on the Democrat side joining that vote.</p><p>So, I mean, this is a little bit of an anticlimactic finish, but, at the same time, I don't know how we ended up with such an ultimately partisan process, where a minority of the Democrats in the House, the Democrat Party, voted for it, and now we're going to see probably 50 -- potentially 55 or 56 senators voting to acquit the president.</p><p>It's really an extraordinary moment in American history. But some of this is, we just don't know how long it's going to go tonight, whether they're going to go to Saturday, whether the Democrats are going to try to hold it over until next week.</p><p>It's going to be -- I think the American people are kind of tiring of this process and know the outcome and would like it to just end and get on with the business of the American people.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, a lot of the drama of this moment was taken away when Lisa Murkowski of Alaska followed this trend away from urgently needing witnesses.</p><p>Lamar Alexander was the first to say that he wouldn't. And therein lied, as you said, Matthew, this notion that you could cobble together 51 Republican senators to go ahead and vote for witnesses.</p><p>Taking their names out of it, barring any surprise from any other members, they didn't have the votes to do that, even if it got to 50, and in the event, there would still not be a change in that policy.</p><p>So, the witness thing supposedly settled, but not necessarily concluding this, which would likely be not until next week.</p><p>Do you know why it would take that long to wrap it up? Because the argument was prior to get it done before the president addresses the nation for his State of the Union address on February 4.</p><p>WHITAKER: Yes, several thoughts on that, Neil.</p><p>One is, I think what Senator Murkowski did to take this decision away from putting pressure on the chief justice, who's presiding over this, in the event of a 50/50 tie, was, was quite an extraordinary really sacrifice for her, whether she pays a -- would pay a political price to vote for witnesses or not.</p><p>But you're right. What we're going to see is, if you remember, when this process started, is, Chuck Schumer made the Republicans vote against calling the witnesses on the front end of this trial. And now we're probably going to see the same process of naming 8, 10, 12 potential witnesses to call, and make those individuals make those votes.</p><p>And then I think -- I think there's a real question for the majority leader as to whether he wants to acquit the president at midnight or 2:00 a.m. on a Friday night, or whether they want to hold this over until -- and so the argument that they did it in the dark of night can't be used against them.</p><p>I mean, obviously, there's -- this has put some pressure on senators on both sides, quite frankly. You talk about Mr. Jones from Alabama. I mean, he's in a very tough reelection. And so he's going to probably vote to acquit.</p><p>And so there's several senators on both sides that are in tough spots based on this -- this impeachment trial, but I think the American people and everyone I talked to when I was back in Iowa, where you are right now, yesterday, what I heard is, this impeachment trial has gone on long enough.</p><p>We all know the truth. And the truth is that the president did not commit an impeachable offense and should be acquitted.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Matthew, you thank you very, very much.</p><p>I want to bring Chad Pergram into this.</p><p>They going back and forth on the need for witnesses or whether you just essentially wrap it up. And now we have this waiting for a quorum vote. I'm not sure of the parliamentary procedures, the right term, but I know Chad Pergram is.</p><p>Chad, what are we waiting for here?</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's the big question here.</p><p>We have not really seen one of these quorum calls in the middle of this trial. There was a live quorum call, where you're actually trying to take the attendance of the senators, when they started this process about two weeks ago.</p><p>They do this all the time in the Senate, where they have a fake quorum call. And what that signals is, they don't know what's coming next. Remember, we had that rather extended recess that was supposed to be for about 15 minutes last hour, went for about 45 minutes.</p><p>That tells you, Neil, that the wheels are turning big time here on Capitol Hill. What they're trying to do offstage is get some sort of an agreement, so they know what the lay of the land is, what the map is for the rest of tonight, maybe this weekend, and maybe bringing the impeachment plane in for a landing sometime in the coming days.</p><p>Here's what has to happen. At some point later tonight, there will be the vote to reject having witnesses. We know how that's going to go. There are at least 51 senators who will vote against that. There will be defections on the Republican side of the aisle, Republican Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah.</p><p>Then it's anybody's ball game. Under the framework approved last week, you could have almost motions made ad infinitum. And that's where they're trying to forge an agreement as to what is next. What's on the docket?</p><p>Well, how much time and when would the impeachment managers and the defense counsel have an opportunity to present their final arguments here? How much time, if any, would senators have the opportunity to come and actually speak and give their points of view, wrap this up, from their perspective?</p><p>We haven't really heard from senators during this impeachment trial, unless it's been in the press gallery or down in the Senate subway station or on TV networks. They have been muted for, obviously, two weeks. So, they want to say something and actually deliberate, debate, and also then say, is there a universe of amendments or proposals that either McConnell or Schumer has to say, OK, here are some final things that we want the Senate to consider?</p><p>Most of those would probably come from the Senate minority side, from Chuck Schumer. He indicated last hour that there is no agreement.</p><p>So what are we looking at here? If there's no agreement -- and when you get an agreement in the Senate, what they do is, the term of art here is, you propound a unanimous consent agreement. They do this all day long in the Senate. What time are they going to meet? What time are they going to vote on? On what are they going to vote?</p><p>How much time is somebody going to have to debate? This is no different than that. But you have to have all 100, unanimous consent, come together.</p><p>That motion would probably be offered by Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and then it sets in stone what the road map is for the rest of this Senate trial, what they do tonight, what they do tomorrow, what has been whispered in my ear, maybe what they do on Sunday.</p><p>Now, supposedly, under the Senate impeachment rules, they don't do that. But if you're trying to get everybody out for Iowa and before State of the Union, maybe Sunday is in play here.</p><p>The other issue that they're facing, if they don't want to punt the final verdict votes until next Wednesday, is, they have to deal with State of the Union. And what was presented to me in the past two hours, Neil, is this logistical hurdle of having all of this security at the U.S. Capitol for the State of the Union address on Tuesday.</p><p>And they're already here starting to work through that, and simultaneously conducting this impeachment trial. That's a real challenge. And so maybe, if they can forge an agreement, where everybody gets their -- their say, and gets out of Dodge, maybe wrap this up over the weekend, or take a pause, get through State of the Union, get through the Iowa caucus, and then come back Wednesday, Thursday next week.</p><p>But they have to have an agreement. And that could be subjected to a vote or you could do it on the floor via unanimous consent. But that's what's in play right now.</p><p>And that's why you have this time-out, because they are trying to negotiate something. If you don't have a deal, what do you do? You go to one of these fake quorum calls, which is what they're in right now, when there's nobody ready to speak, or you're trying to figure out the next steps.</p><p>That is a case in point of what's playing out on the floor right now, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, Chad, there's also the possibility that, in order to deal with -- and I never thought of it that way, that you're going to have the president of the United States giving an address to the country from the wall of the House while this impeachment thing is going on.</p><p>Would there be any talk about pushing that speech back, because you can't do two simultaneously?</p><p>PERGRAM: Well, that's why they talk about maybe this pause, this donut hole, do that in the middle somewhere, for the Iowa caucus, and also for State of the Union.</p><p>No one has said to me directly that there's conversation about pushing back State of the Union. Then you get into some pretty complicated logistical questions, what the president wants to do. Really, it's up to the speaker of the House. She holds the cards there.</p><p>That was the whole thing last year. Remember, we were supposed to have the State of the Union during the government shutdown. And they eventually called it off for a while, until the government shutdown was resolved. And then the president came once they reopened the government.</p><p>I wouldn't rule that out, but no one has directly said that to me.</p><p>But if you get kind of stuck in the tar pit here, as they try to figure out what's next for the trial, and you have these other real-world logistical problems arising. I wouldn't be surprised if somebody started to discuss that very scenario and maybe -- and I will underscore maybe -- postponing State of the Union.</p><p>But nobody has said that to me yet.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, when we were talking about the fact that Republicans have succeeded in quashing this -- this push for witnesses -- even if Mitt Romney and Susan Collins were to make the push, that wouldn't get you to the 51 witnesses, assuming all 47 Democrats voted for witnesses.</p><p>You would -- you would need at least for, three to avoid putting the chief justice in a pickle. So, do we know that all the other Republicans are inclined not to, after we heard from Lamar Alexander, after we heard from Lisa Murkowski, that they are in line with Mitch McConnell on this, in other words, no witnesses?</p><p>PERGRAM: Right.</p><p>Right. That seems to be the case right now, that the Republicans have the votes to quash that. That said -- and that's why we have to watch what the organic motions are that Chuck Schumer could come up with.</p><p>If you go back to that organizing resolution that they approved last week - - and we had all of those motions made deep into the night by Chuck Schumer -- you would be in a similar scenario.</p><p>And this is where Chuck Schumer could basically continue to string this out, and maybe put Republicans on the line by getting them to take tough votes late tonight or tomorrow, if they don't have an agreement.</p><p>And that's why it's in people's interest maybe to get an agreement so they don't have too many of those votes. They address the time issues. They address the Iowa issues, the State of the Union issues.</p><p>And here is the other issue that really is sitting in the back of everybody's mind, especially at the White House and among Republicans who are loyal to President Trump. Is there some other ticking time bomb out there that could explode if you don't put this to a final verdict vote sometime soon?</p><p>You strike when the iron is high. And the longer that you stretch this out, the chances are greater for that probability, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Chad, this is going to go outside your purview, but it was just me thinking of this.</p><p>Of course, this is set in stone that the president -- I think it increasingly seems to be set in stone, is not going to be impeached, but that both feel increasingly uncomfortable, given...</p><p>PERGRAM: Not convicted. Not convicted.</p><p>CAVUTO: Not convicted, I'm sorry, but that both parties are getting increasingly nervous about the backdrop for all this, a huge sell-off on Wall Street today, this coronavirus that's accelerating, where the president has taken emergency measures to work at preventing this from getting to be a problem here, to say nothing of Iowa, where I sit right now, and the impending caucuses and primaries about to roll on.</p><p>How much of that is figuring into these discussions?</p><p>PERGRAM: That's remarkable, too, because there was a briefing for House members yesterday, mostly those who deal with a health portfolio, about coronavirus.</p><p>We have heard very little chatter about that, because everybody has been so focused on what's been going on with the Senate impeachment trial. And then, as you mentioned, the consequences on Wall Street and the economy and airlines not flying to China now. And what are the economic impacts here in the United States?</p><p>In fact, I went to one Capitol security official two days ago to ask -- I said, what, have they talked to you about coronavirus here? And they said, I can't really tell you much, because I have been tied up with the Senate trial.</p><p>It tells you a lot that this is consuming so much oxygen, that maybe there's something else lurking out there. And they're having trouble addressing some of these other issues as they evolve, be it with the economy, be it with Wall Street or the health issues potentially posed by coronavirus.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you, my friend very, very much, Chad Pergram following all of this.</p><p>Just to let you know, there's been a break in the action here on the impeachment trial here.</p><p>And the debate started over witnesses, when we would get a vote on that, and then arguing the wisdom of that, and the fact that Republicans seem to have secured the votes to avoid witnesses, and then this quorum that has sort of popped up in the middle of all of this.</p><p>Ron Paul is joining us right now, of course, the former presidential candidate, the former congressman.</p><p>Congressman, always good to have you.</p><p>Your son Rand Paul ran into a buzz saw with no less than the chief justice over this issue of speaking and potentially bringing up something apparently the chief justice didn't want, the possibility of mentioning the whistle-blower's name.</p><p>And it's caused bad feelings that seem not to have eased. How do you feel about all that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RON PAUL (R), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: Well, I'm not allowed to talk about my son and get emotional about it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAUL: But I will tell you what.</p><p>I -- I think that, when you're onto the truth and onto something very important, they come down hard on you, and they try to isolate you.</p><p>So I would say that his point is well-taken. And the amount of effort to try to say, hey, we don't want to talk about this, the two-party system isn't really two-party. They work together when they spend money and go to war and all these kind of things.</p><p>But there are times when there will be some disagreements and -- or agreements. In this case, I think the majority just agreed that, oh, no, we don't want to follow the rules and let people know what we're doing.</p><p>And so they -- they have given him a little grief.</p><p>But, of course, I think he's on the right track.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, in the meantime, the chief justice maybe dodged a bullet when Lisa Murkowski of Alaska indicated, Congressman, that she will not push for witnesses, thereby saving him the possibility of breaking a 50/50 tie in the United States Senate and putting him in the position, will I force the issue or not?</p><p>What did you think of that?</p><p>PAUL: Well, I think the whole thing about whether we should have witnesses or not, if it were real, if this was a real thing, and not inundated with political ideology -- this is a political stunt.</p><p>And it's worse than ever. They say that impeachment is a political process. Well, this is even -- even excessively political.</p><p>So I think that -- that people are very up in arms. But to have more witnesses now just -- just doesn't make a lot of sense.</p><p>And yet, on principle, I say, well, why not have more witnesses? In a real trial, if they were very serious, and somebody had committed a crime and deserved this type of attention, then, yes, there should be witnesses it should go for a year if you had to.</p><p>But this is all major stunt that's going on. We have an election coming up real soon. This is a political activity for the next election. And people who dislike the president...</p><p>CAVUTO: But which -- who is pulling the stunt? Congressman, who's pulling the stunt?</p><p>I mean, it appears, from the way you have sort of questioned the chief justice not letting your son raise a question, and he walks out of the Senate, you hold both parties accountable for that kind of behavior?</p><p>PAUL: Well, maybe so.</p><p>But I think you have to look at the issue of what's going on. And I think this is all grandstanding. And it has nothing to do with something that is serious enough, but it's serious enough -- because, see, the way I see this whole thing is that people are very jealous of the president, and they're jealous of the president, and they hate his guts.</p><p>But -- and they're dumbfounded, they're just hysterical because the -- because the financial statistics are sort of going his way, even though I have questions about those statistics, but they're -- politically, they're going his way.</p><p>There's a lot of good things on there. So they hate his guts. This is -- this is driven by political hatred. And, in a way, the president attracts that type of things, because he's bold. He speaks out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, do you then think that the chief justice -- Ron Paul, I'm sorry.</p><p>Do you think then that the chief justice was acting on Democrats' behalf when he didn't let Rand Paul speak, or at least ask his question?</p><p>PAUL: No, I think he was acting -- I think he was acting on his own behalf that -- I think that he still has sort of a bias that encouraged him to do this, because why shouldn't they -- eventually, they name the person.</p><p>Everybody knows the name of the whistle-blower. And the whistle-blower is crucial. And when -- they shove him in a corner. This is the whole thing. The whole thing is politicized by this so-called whistle-blower.</p><p>And it's the biggest issue. And it's the undermining of the system because of that. And they go, oh, we don't want to do this.</p><p>On the big items, the parties agree with things. They're fighting like cats and dogs right now. When it comes to the war issues, the money issues, the spending issues, the deficits issue, they get along quite well.</p><p>Even during this trial, they have been able to pause to pass the bills, passed the legislation and pass out the money. They get along pretty good there.</p><p>So I think that a lot of it is grandstanding, and it's politicized. And, unfortunately, the people suffer. I think that that is the -- that is the biggest problem, because this is really totally unnecessary.</p><p>It's been provoked, of course, by the agitation of both Republicans and Democrats. But that's how superficial it is. Do they want to talk about the budget? Do they want to talk about monetary policy and the Federal Reserve and going to war?</p><p>No. They would much rather do this. It's a total distraction, which is bringing this country down. And that's what this is all about, total distraction.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you might be right about -- the whistle-blower thing maybe was about -- using whistle-blower, the threat that your son might raise the whistle-blower, as a way to hide discussion of the very issues that you talked about.</p><p>Your son had said that his actual question got to the core of the argument that Democratic partisans left over from the Obama administration were conspiring to go after this president, to impeach this president, or set up something that would lead to his impeachment.</p><p>Do you believe that?</p><p>PAUL: Well, I think both sides are undermining the opposite side.</p><p>And, superficially, yes -- yes, they do this. They always try to undermine the other side. It's always political. Everything is political, when it comes to that.</p><p>So...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: So, you think we will see more of that in the future, then, Congressman, that now this has been so partisanized, if that's such a term, that it's going to continue...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAUL: Yes. Yes.</p><p>And there's a good reason for this. They have run out of straws to pull. They have run out of -- they can't lower the interest rates anymore. They can't do anything. We're totally bankrupt.</p><p>And we can't manage and -- manage -- manage our armed forces overseas. And we have run out of money to prop up the economy. And when the recession really hits, it'll be the responsibility of the Republicans and Democrats. And that will be the big thing.</p><p>So,, yes, it's going to get much, much worse, because they won't deal with the problem. And the problem is big government. And when it comes to doing that, oh, no, we will be together. On the big issues, Republicans and Democrats go together.</p><p>They fight and fume and pretend they hate each other's guts. And they do. They have the personal battles, which is a contradiction. But I will tell you what. They try to pass it. It's just over -- and get people to go along with these so-called compromises.</p><p>But we're in a bigger mess than anybody wants to admit. And that's why they're doing all these other shenanigans, and it turns into personal fights, because they don't know -- they don't have the ability to do what they have to do, because to preserve our society and our economy, we would have to cut spending.</p><p>They're not going to cut spending. The Republicans are every bit as good, if not better than the Democrats on spending.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>PAUL: And, also -- also, they work together when it really hurts the people.</p><p>And that's where I think it's a real tragedy. And, hopefully, more of that will come out someday, but, right now, no, it's all going to be a gimmick.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. Well, it's not happening now, to your point.</p><p>Ron Paul, thank you very much. Always good chatting with you.</p><p>PAUL: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>In the meantime, I do want to go to Reggie Love, the former Barack Obama personal aide who is backing Mayor Pete Buttigieg right now. He joins us on all of this.</p><p>And, Reggie, very good to have you.</p><p>Without getting into politics and your backing for Mayor Pete, of course, who's obviously competing in these caucuses in the state of which I reside right now, is it your sense that both parties are getting nervous about how this impeachment thing could look like it's a distraction to the things that are very, very important?</p><p>The Republicans, the president's tried to say, I'm focusing on the coronavirus and all of this, but that both parties in a way are saying, enough already, we're getting frantic here?</p><p>REGGIE LOVE, FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA AIDE: Yes, look, I think that the impeachment process is important.</p><p>I think it's probably not turned out the way that Democrats would like and probably the way most Americans would like. I think people want all Americans, and including the president, to be held accountable to the law.</p><p>But, look, the process is what it is. And I think that's what gives American people the hope as to why this election coming up in 2020 is really important.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you get nervous when you see your guy -- he's slipping a little in polls.</p><p>As you remind me, they're meaningless right now. Those same goals gave Barack Obama no chance of beating Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump from eventually becoming president.</p><p>Having said that, though, that Bernie Sanders seems to be surging at just the right time. Do you worry about that, as someone who backs Mayor Pete?</p><p>LOVE: You know, I look at the data I'm seeing on the ground.</p><p>And in the last 19 days, Mayor Pete's done over 40-plus town halls, he's gotten over 1,000 people in four different occasions to come out.</p><p>And when you look at the diversity of the crowd, it's not only Democrats who are excited about this upcoming election. They're -- they're new caucus-goers who've never caucused before in their life. They are Republicans. They are people that voted for Trump in '16, Obama in '12, and have decided that they they're moderate and want to come back to this side of the aisle.</p><p>So I'm very encouraged.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>LOVE: And if you look at -- if you look at the size of the organization, he's got over 100 field organizers on the ground, and over 30 field offices throughout the state of Iowa.</p><p>So...</p><p>CAVUTO: And we won't know until people vote, Reggie. We won't know, will we?</p><p>Thank you very much, Reggie. I apologize for our truncated time.</p><p>LOVE: No.</p><p>CAVUTO: We're still waiting to see how they decide this quorum issue, and new talk that Mitch McConnell is trying to end this at least by or right after the president's State of the Union address.</p><p>We shall see.</p><p>But at the corner of Wall and Broad, they were more interested in selling. And so they did, largely on a virus that has nothing to do with impeachment. That one looks out of control.</p><p>Here comes ""The Five.""</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">FOXNWS-2020013101cb140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5Y3V-56J1-DXH2-640V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""8754""/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=""31"" month=""01"" year=""2020""><dateText>January 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""typeofdoc""><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""company""><classificationItem score=""72""><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""industry""><classificationItem score=""72""><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""72""><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""licensor.indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""licensor.subject""><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ron Paul</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ukraine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trials</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>White House</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Matthew Whitaker</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republican Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""legal""><classificationItem><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=""50""><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0JCMDA3OEMzRjM2NDJGRkIwQUFCNEFCMEM2QzFCRDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzIzQjhEQkQ0QkYxNDkzMEEyMjhGMEFBNUUxNTNERDk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=""83""><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUQ4OUEwREY0NzU2NDIwQTlDQ0VDMjJDNTJERjA3QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""73""><className>Judicial &amp;

That's it for us. (INAUDIBLE) Super Bowl fun, enjoy your Sunday special -- THE FIVE --</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. Senators have just defeated a measure to call witnesses in the president's impeachment trial by a vote of 51 to 49.</p><p>It is a major step toward what now looks like an inevitable acquittal in this trial for President Trump. What is still to be determined is the process of how to get there and how long this trial may still go on.</p><p>Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel tells us where things stand at this minute. A lot is been changing. Good evening, Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: Yes, Bret. No question. Good evening to you. Within the last few minutes, Republicans defeating that critical vote on witnesses as expected, 51 to 49. Moments ago, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, saying about it. ""Never in Senate history has this body pause an impeachment trial to pursue additional witnesses with unresolved questions of executive privilege that would require protracted litigation. We have no interest in establishing such a new precedent, particularly for individuals whom the House expressly chose not to pursue.""</p><p>Much of the day, attorneys for both sides made their case ahead of that critical vote on witnesses.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Rob this country of a fair trial, and there can be no representation that the verdict has any meaning. How could it?</p><p>JAY SEKULOW, CHIEF COUNSEL, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Do not allow them to penalize the country and the Constitution, because if they failed to do their job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: The Senate Democratic leader tried to apply some last-minute pressure earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): If my Republican colleagues refuse to even consider witnesses and documents in this trial, this country is headed towards the greatest cover-up since Watergate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham was quick to fire back at Schumer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Well, I think I can live with this criticism. It wasn't a fair process. First time in history, we've impeached the president so damn partisan lines in the House. Actually, a bipartisan reject (INAUDIBLE). If Senator Schumer is OK with this, be careful what you wish for.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: A decisive blow to Democrats came from Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski, saying, ""I carefully consider the need for additional witnesses and documents, to cure the shortcomings of its process. I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything.""</p><p>Late last night, retiring Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander said some of the president's actions were inappropriate but said that does not meet the Constitution's high bar for impeachable offense. So, Alexander declared he would vote no on more witnesses.</p><p>Today, Ohio Senator Rob Portman, gave him some cover, ""I believe that some of the president's actions, in this case, were wrong and inappropriate. But I do not believe that the president's actions rise to the level of removing a duly-elected president from office and taking him off the ballot in the middle of an election.""</p><p>Timing of the final acquittal vote is the question of this hour. We've got lawmakers meeting with their leadership trying to hammer it out. It's not entirely clear whether they go home for the weekend, and come back, and perhaps, resolve this after Tuesday State of the Union Address, a lot in flux at this hour.</p><p>Bottom line, I'm told attorneys for President Trump want to hit the gas and get this over with as quickly as possible. There are a number of Senate Republicans who agree with them. But there are also a lot of senators who would like an opportunity to speak on the Senate floor about this moment in history after they've been spectators for much of the trial. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Yes, that's the battle behind closed doors. We're told the two South Carolina -- South Dakota senators, Republican Senator Thune, just said we're still trying to figure out how to land the plane. Senator Mike Braun, just a matter of agreeing how we land the plane.</p><p>They're trying to land the plane, Mike, but it seems like there's some process in the way that could get sticky for, at least, a few days.</p><p>EMANUEL: Yes, and no doubt about it. Look, bottom line, these senators are fatigue, their staffs are fatigued. A lot of people are looking for a way out of this. There are clearly some Democrats who want to get to Iowa as quickly as possible. You've got Amy Klobuchar with events there tomorrow. You've got Elizabeth Warren with an event there later tonight if she can make it.</p><p>And so, there's a lot of interest in getting out of here. But there's also a lot of anger on both sides of this issue. Extremely polarized conditions, and so, they have to find the votes and agreement on a path forward to work the process to get to that acquittal vote which is not in doubt, but the question of the timing is what is in doubt. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: All right, Mike Emanuel, live on the Hill. Mike, thanks. We'll head back for any nuggets that you gather up there. Where Chad Pergram, also up on the Hill, digging things out. Tonight, President Trump is tweeting, the Democrats are scamming America in the impeachment trial, and that they had no case from the beginning.</p><p>Likely, a very pleased President Trump with that vote that just happened. He's traveling to Florida as we speak on Air Force One. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts is live on the North Lawn of the White House with the latest. Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. One plane that we do know will be landing soon is Air Force One. The president expected to touch down in West Palm Beach, sometime the next half hour to 45 minutes.</p><p>He didn't talk to the media on his way out of the White House to Mar-a-Lago this afternoon, earlier in the day. He didn't take aim at new allegations leveled at him in the new John Bolton book that's coming out in March. That is if it is eventually clear. But the president also spends some time keeping the business of the nation going today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a lot of great senators that wanted to be here so desperately. But I said, just stay where you are and do your job, please.</p><p>JOHN G. ROBERTS, CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES: Senators, please be seated.</p><p>J. ROBERTS: Impeachment was never far away, even when the topic was the scourge of human trafficking. President Trump, today signing an executive order to create a full-time White House position to combat the problem, and other measures.</p><p>TRUMP: This order expands prevention education programs, promotes housing opportunities for survivors, and prioritizes the removal of child sexual abuse material from the Internet.</p><p>J. ROBERTS: But the president was also pushing back against another 11th- hour revelation from John Bolton's forthcoming book. The New York Times reporting that in May, President Trump directed Bolton to set up a meeting between Rudy Giuliani and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Bolton, says he never acted on the request.</p><p>The President dismissed the claim, and a statement saying, ""I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudy Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America, and by far, the greatest mayor in the history of New York City to meet with President Zelensky. That meeting never happened.""</p><p>In his call with President Zelensky, July 25th, President Trump, himself, asked Zelensky three times to speak with Giuliani. Saying, ""Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man, and I would like him to call you. I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call. I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.""</p><p>The Democratic House managers left on the new report, as to Joe Biden campaigning in Iowa.</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My job is simple. I just got to go out and beat him.</p><p>J. ROBERTS: Coincidentally, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in Ukraine today, meeting with Zelensky. Pompeo, again denying that an Oval Office visit was conditioned on Zelensky announcing investigations into Burisma and the Bidens.</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: No, there's -- there is no condition of the nature you described for President Zelensky, come to Washington and have that visit. So, it's just simply not the case.</p><p>President Zelensky will be welcome to come to Washington when we have an opportunity to do good things for both the Ukrainian people and the American people.</p><p>J. ROBERTS: Asked about it, Zelensky carefully towed a diplomatic line.</p><p>VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through-translator): In the state of Ukraine, there is no doubt whatsoever regarding the strategic partnership with the United States of America. That's why we are confident in the successful realization of all our common plans.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>J. ROBERTS: According to The New York Times, Rudy Giuliani, the Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and the White House Counsel Pat Cipollone we're all in the room when President Trump allegedly told John Bolton to reach out to Zelensky.</p><p>But both Giuliani and Mick Mulvaney had said that anytime, the conversation turned to matters of Ukraine, everybody else except Giuliani would leave the room in order to preserve attorney-client privilege.</p><p>And, Bret, the president has just tweeted not really a response so much to the vote in the Senate, but the president tweeting moments ago, Democrats equals 17 witnesses. Republicans equals zero witnesses.</p><p>And one thing we do know from this afternoon's vote, there will be no more witnesses. So, it will stand at 17-0, and the president will try to take that all the way to a win in November. Saying that this whole process was unfair. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: And quickly, John, do we have any sense what the State of the Union feels looks like on Tuesday? Is it a victory lap even if this vote is pushed past that? Any sense from the White House on that?</p><p>J. ROBERTS: Well, the White House actually walked us through the State of the Union just a short time ago. Earlier today, the theme of it is going to be, The Great American Comeback.</p><p>The President, we're told is going to present a vision of relentless optimism in the face of unjustified pessimism by some people in Congress. We tried to push our briefer to say, look at in this environment that's going on in Washington, as the president going to at all make reference to the rancor and the division up there on Capitol Hill.</p><p>The briefer wouldn't let on, but I would assume, Bret that if this impeachment trial has not wrapped up at the time the president gives State of the Union at 9:00 on Tuesday night, you just might hear something about it.</p><p>BAIER: Maybe so.</p><p>All right, John Roberts, live in the North Lawn, John, thanks.</p><p>J. ROBERTS: Thank you.</p><p>BAIER: Big move tonight from the federal government in response to the coronavirus outbreak in China. The Trump administration has declared a public health emergency. That means, four nationals who may pose a quote, contamination danger, will be kept out.</p><p>Correspondent Jonathan Serrie has the latest tonight from Atlanta.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALEX AZAR, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: I have today, declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States.</p><p>JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: In the late afternoon White House briefing, the Trump administration announced, it will temporarily deny U.S. entry to foreign nationals who pose a risk of transmitting a deadly new coronavirus. The temporary restrictions go into effect this Sunday.</p><p>AZAR: Foreign nationals other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled in China within the last 14 days will be denied entry into the United States for this time.</p><p>SERRIE: Additionally, U.S. citizens returning to the United States from China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak will be subjected to a mandatory quarantine of up to 14 days. The virus's incubation period.</p><p>Today, federal health authorities issued quarantine orders for all 195 U.S. citizens, who returned from Wuhan China, aboard this flight landing at March Air Reserve Base on Wednesday.</p><p>NANCY MESSONNIER, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL CENTER FOR IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES: This is the first time in over 50 years that CDC has issued a quarantine order. While we understand this action may seem drastic, our goal today, tomorrow, and always continues to be the safety of the American public.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SERRIE: The deadly coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed more than 200 lives in China has prompted the State Department to issue its highest level four advisory. Do not travel to China.</p><p>Although coronavirus is making headlines, federal health officials believe the threat to the general American public remains low. To put it in perspective, this year's flu season has already made 19 million people sick in this country and claimed 10,000 lives. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: We'll follow this. Jonathan, thank you.</p><p>Markets plunge today on more coronavirus fears. The Dow losing 603 and its worst day since last August. The S&amp;P 500 fell 58, the NASDAQ dropped 148. For the month the Dow lost one percentage point, the S&amp;P 500 dropped one- sixth, the NASDAQ gained two.</p><p>The Trump administration is also expanding its immigration restrictions to six additional countries. Officials say those nations do not meet security standards. They are Kyrgyzstan, Burma, Eritrea, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania.</p><p>Immigrants from those countries will face new restrictions and obtaining certain visas to come to the U.S. The ACLU, says the ban should be ended not expanded, calling the policy anti-Muslim.</p><p>In tonight's ""DEMOCRACY 2020"" report, the Iowa caucuses will be held in three days. Oh yes. The new poll shows Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, virtually neck and neck in the Democratic presidential race.</p><p>Meanwhile, a rules change as the Bloomberg campaign ecstatic tonight and the rest of the field not so much. Correspondent Peter Doocy reports tonight from Des Moines.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS GENERAL ASSIGNMENT REPORTER: Joe Biden is telling Iowa Democrats that Bernie Sanders isn't exactly a Democrat.</p><p>BIDEN: He calls himself a Democratic socialist. We have a different view on a whole lot of things.</p><p>DOOCY: Now, Biden is behind Bernie Sanders in a new NBC News Wall Street Journal survey. The Sanders' lead, which is within the margin of error, has grown, even though he's stuck in the Senate and relying on surrogates, like his wife to defend against charges that he's not a Democrat.</p><p>JANE SANDERS, WIFE OF BERNIE SANDERS: I think people realize that in Vermont, we don't have party registration.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>SANDERS: So, you just say what you are.</p><p>DOOCY: Amy Klobuchar doesn't know if she'll make it to Iowa by caucus night, telling reporters covering the impeachment trial. ""You may have heard the rumor today about this going into next week. And I've got a few other things going on at the same time. But my view is the people of Iowa and beyond will understand I'm in the arena.""</p><p>The DNC, says they're staying neutral, but the party is changing a critical rule. Now, you can qualify for debates with polls only, no grassroots donors needed.</p><p>The Sanders campaign says, ""To, now change the rules and the middle of the game to accommodate Mike Bloomberg, who is trying to buy his way into the Democratic nomination, is wrong. That's the definition of a rigged system.""</p><p>The Bloomberg team says they are thrilled if they tease a Super Bowl ad about gun control.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I heard Mike was stepping into the ring. I thought, now, we have a dog in the fight.</p><p>DOOCY: Bloomberg campaign announced today, they spent $132 million on ads by the end of last year. On a campaign that's less about Bloomberg and more about Trump.</p><p>Michael Bloomberg was asked if the country wanted a race between two New York billionaires, and his response to that was who is the other one? Do you think he's trying to get under your skin?</p><p>TRUMP: No, he's mini Mike, come in. He was very -- he did a poor job, and the last --- his last time it was terrible. And frankly --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOOCY: Does he get under your skin?</p><p>TRUMP: No, no.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY: The DNC changed the rules to debate now, but they didn't back in December when candidates like Cory Booker and Julian Castro were asking them to lower the threshold to make the stage so it could be more diverse. And the first one, Mike Bloomberg could possibly qualify for -- is in Nevada, a state he is not even competing in. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Peter Doocy live in the morning. We will be there tomorrow. See there, Peter. Thanks. Up next, Brexit becomes official. Tonight, we'll go live to London. First here's some of our Fox affiliates around the country covering tonight. Fox 5 in New York, a key accuser in the trial of movie producer Harvey Weinstein testifies. He trapped her in a hotel room angrily ordered her to undress and raped her. But the woman told jurors she stayed in contact with him because his ego was ""fragile."" Weinstein has insisted any sexual encounters were consensual. A conviction could put him behind bars for the rest of his life.</p><p>WSVN in Miami with video of confessed Parkland High School shooter Nikolas Cruz attacking a Broward sheriff's deputy while in jail. It happened in November 2018. The video surfacing yesterday. Cruz killed 17 people, wounded 17 others in the shootings in February of that year.</p><p>And this is a live look at San Diego from Fox 5, one of the big stories there tonight. Officials discuss how new federal funding could help stem the tide of pollution flowing from Tijuana into San Diego. The new North American Free Trade Deal, the USMCA, allocates $300 million to fund a border water infrastructure project.</p><p>That is tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: Breaking tonight, as of about 20 minutes ago, the United Kingdom is officially out of the European Union. Brexit became reality at the top of the hour. So what does it all mean? Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent Greg Palkot is live in London right now. Good morning, Greg.</p><p>GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Bret. Yes, it has finally happened. Britain has formally exited the European Union or as we've been calling it for a very long time, Brexit. There was a huge raucous crowd outside of Big Ben and Parliament tonight. They counted down the break to 11:00 p.m. here or midnight Brussels time.</p><p>The departure was agreed to in a referendum three and a half years ago. They've been haggling over it ever since. In a T.V. address tonight, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for unity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, PRIME MINISTER, UNITED KINGDOM: The most important thing to say tonight is that this is not an end, but the beginning. This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PALKOT: Now, not everybody was happy about all this. There were other anti- Brexit gatherings across the country. Critics fear that rather than independence, the move could hurt the economy and do real damage to the U.K. itself. Now, as the Union Jack was lower for the last time in front of the European Union headquarters, some say the hard part really begins.</p><p>In a transition period to the end of this year, the U.K. and the E.U. had to sort out all sorts of new arrangements on trade and security, for example. This could mean another extension, also free to start work on a new trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. President Trump is a big backer of Brexit. He says it's going to be a big deal, some say it's not a done deal yet, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Greg Palkot live in London. Greg, thanks. Up next, the battle off the field to keep the Super Bowl safe. First, beyond our borders tonight, Iraq's most powerful religious figure reiterates his condemnation of the use of force against anti-government protesters. The comment from Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani comes as the mass movement enters a critical juncture and political blocks tussle over naming a new premier.</p><p>The Australian Capital Region is now under a state of emergency because of an out of -- out of control forest fire burning erratically to its south. Emergency Services Agency says the threat is posed by a blaze on Canberra's southern fringe that has raised more than 53,000 acres since it was sparked by heat from a military helicopter landing, Monday.</p><p>Poland signs a $4.6 billion deal with the U.S. for the purchase of 32 F-35 fighter jets. The planes will be used to enhance air defense on NATO's eastern flank at a time of increased Russian military activity there. Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: Breaking tonight, senators are on break after voting 51 to 49 not to go forward with witnesses. Now, we don't know the way forward from here. Let's talk about it with Minnesota Democrat senator, presidential candidate, Amy Klobuchar. Senator, thanks for the time.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, thanks, Bret. It's great to be on again.</p><p>BAIER: I want to get you to react first to the witness vote and what you think is happening moving forward.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I really thought we should have witnesses. And you could see Mitt Romney has been outspoken about this for quite a while. I think the reason is this. The truth is going to come out and people could vote the way they want on impeachment. I get that people are going to have different opinions. But I really felt that it was important to have the witnesses because we've always had witnesses in these trials and 70 percent of the public want to see witnesses.</p><p>And I really believe with the Bolton revelations that have come out. It's not going to be five years from now that we know what happened in those rooms, it's going to probably be five days from now or five weeks from now. And I think it is better to get testimony under oath and then people can make decisions.</p><p>BAIER: We're reporting at this hour that Democratic amendments tonight include no weekend session, Monday, Tuesday, comments on the floor, and then Wednesday afternoon a final vote. Are you OK with that?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: We have been pushing for witnesses and I would assume some of the amendments that have been some discussion since this went down now on that close 51-49 vote about what kind of amendments to extend the timetable, to get specific witnesses, to get specific documents. So that's going to be the discussions.</p><p>And I would like to do whatever we take -- it takes to get a fair trial for the people of America and we're just waiting word and what we work out here.</p><p>BAIER: But you don't have the votes, Senator, so why go through those processes if you're, you know, obviously trying to get to Iowa other people are as well, why go through that if you know, you don't have the votes?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: That just can't be my motivating force, Bret. I've got to bet that the people in Iowa understand that I'm doing my job. I'm in the arena. You know, other people can say I don't want to look at what's going on there? I've got to do my job and get to the truth.</p><p>BAIER: All right, I want to ask you about Iowa in a second, but Jonathan Turley, law professor cited by both sides, cited about the House managers a number of times.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: He just went off. Bret just went off.</p><p>BAIER: Oh, can you hear me?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I can't hear. Guys?</p><p>BAIER: Can you hear me now?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: The volume went off.</p><p>BAIER: All right, we'll come back to the center in a second. Well, how about now? Do you got me now? No. All right, how about this? We'll go bring our panel in. Matthew Continetti, Susan Ferruccio, and Jeff Mason as we wait for the audio to reestablish.</p><p>What about this, Matthew? Obviously, Senator Klobuchar is saying they're going to continue to fight for witnesses, even though that witness fight is over.</p><p>It is over and I think that means that impeachment is over. And to people who thought that this had a chance of removing Donald Trump from office before the election were wrong, as I think many of us predicted. I actually think Brett Nancy Pelosi made a terrible mistake opening up this impeachment inquiry. If she had just allowed this story to kind of on a slow boil to unwind over time, you could have had hearings from last September up until Election Day, 2020. Instead by moving for impeachment, right, in order to secure our left flank, she has handed Donald Trump an acquittal, which we know he will crow about as soon as it happens.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Susan?</p><p>SUSAN FERRECHIO, ""WASHINGTON EXAMINER"": He's already crowing about it.</p><p>CONTINETTI: As he should.</p><p>FERRECHIO: Well, I think this week is going to be a slow landing of the plane. We talked about how do you land this plane? Well, it looks like they are going to debate this a couple more days. This will give senators an opportunity to talk about their vote, to talk about the case for or against acquitting the president, for or against why they voted on witnesses, and this gives them that opportunity.</p><p>They did this during the Clinton impeachment trial. It was in a closed session. They are going to insist this be in open session so that the public can see it. We, in the press, of course, love that. That's what we want. But it will take them a couple days. And it's a negotiated ending to this because people didn't like the idea of having a dark of night vote. They wanted time to let the public see what they were doing.</p><p>BAIER: Chad Pergram has been at that camera for a long time, and I guess the batteries ran out on the microphone. So we Senator Klobuchar back with us.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Sorry about that.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I didn't go away.</p><p>BAIER: Thank you very much.</p><p>I was reading this quote from Jonathan Turley, who has been quoted by the House managers, the Democrats. He says, this is why I told the Judiciary Committee that it was a monumental mistake to rush the impeachment vote on an incomplete record and hand over their case to the other house and the opposing party. This will go down as a blunder of historic measure by the House leadership. Your reaction to that?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Yes, I just don't agree, because we have already seen in the Don McGahn court case that they keep appealing, the White House, about not producing these witnesses, and they know very well that they can put all the president's men, even a few of them, up to testify just like they have done in past impeachment hearings. So I don't buy that. I think they just don't want those witnesses to come forward. And, again, eventually, the truth is going to come out.</p><p>And the other thing I would say about it is every day that goes by, you now have General Kelly, President Trump's former chief of staff, saying the job is half-done, that there should be witnesses. You have a number of other people, including, of course, Mr. Bolton and John Warner, the former senator from Virginia, who have come forward, these are Republicans, and said that you should have a thorough trial with witnesses. So I just view it as a consistent effort to stop these witnesses from testifying.</p><p>BAIER: Let's talk about Iowa. How much do people when you are on the ground ask you about impeachment?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: They do some, especially when things are going on like this hearing. But a lot of them are still focused on healthcare and on prescription drugs, on cost of college. But I do think this election, especially for moderate Republicans and independents, is more than just an economic check. I tell them all the time, especially people showing up at my events that may have voted for the president or may have stayed home, I tell them, look, you may not agree with everything that is said on the debate stage. I don't agree with everything on the debate stage. But this election is going to be a decency check and a patriotism check. And they, many of them, believe that we should have a president that isn't putting his private interests in front of the interests of this country. And that's why they are showing up at my events.</p><p>BAIER: Are you better positioned against Donald Trump than Joe Biden? Do you think this impeachment hearing has hurt Joe Biden and his ability to go head-to-head with Donald Trump?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I'm going to let the pundits decide all of that. I have a lot of respect for the vice president. But I know this about me, and that is that I am someone that's from the Midwest. It's not flyover country to me. I'm one of two candidates left that are from the Midwest. I'm also someone in another generation. And I'm somewhere in between the age of Mayor Pete and the vice president. I would say that 59, my age, is the new 38. And I think all of that is a good thing, to have a fresh face, to have someone that is new representing our party at the top of the ticket.</p><p>BAIER: There is one poll just out that has you now in third in Iowa. The average of polls nationally in Iowa and New Hampshire has you in fourth, fifth in Iowa, New Hampshire. Where do you see it on the ground? And where do you have to finish in Iowa by your count?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: That's going to be, I think, just near the top of the group of people. We are in the top five in both states right now, and that is good for me. But I'm doing more than that. We doubled our staff in both states. I just got the endorsement today of the ""Iowa City"" newspaper as well as the Seacoast in New Hampshire adding to the union leader in New Hampshire as well as the Keen paper and the Quad Cities, ""New York Times,"" all of them make that case for me, that I'm someone that can bring our party together and bring people with me. And I think that's very, very important.</p><p>And I have just got to believe despite the fact that three days before the Iowa caucus, I never thought I would be here in the Capitol. I thought I would be out with my competitors doing my job. I just don't think that people are going to hold that against me. I think my experience passing over 100 bills by working across the aisle more than anyone in the Senate running for president, I think that's going to matter.</p><p>BAIER: I just have a minute left. You mentioned the debates. There was a ruling by the DNC that seems to open the door to Mike Bloomberg qualifying for at least one debate coming up. Are you OK with that?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Yes. I think that when you have got someone that is running all those ads all over the place, including a Super Bowl ad, I think that it is better to have that person debating in the case of Mayor Bloomberg than outside just spending a ton of money, because I want to make the case to America that I would be the best one to lead the ticket. And I would rather debate him than have him outdo me on the airways.</p><p>BAIER: And what happens if Bernie Sanders wins Iowa, goes on to win New Hampshire? What happens to the party?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I would say that this is a long, long primary, and there are many steps along the way. I continue to believe that it is best to have someone leading our ticket that, for instance, in my case, I don't support Medicare for all. I read the bill. I never got on it. I'm not going to kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance, which is what that bill says on page eight. I believe with education, I know that free college for all sounds good on a bumper sticker. But I think the best thing is to match our education system with our economy. And when you do that, you see we have over a million openings for home healthcare workers, over 100,000 openings for electricians. We are not going to have a sports marketing degrees. We are going to have a shortage of plumbers.</p><p>So this means investment in K through 12, one and two year degrees, and then doubling the Pell Grants for college students. I think those are plans and not pipe dreams. They are progressive but they are practical.</p><p>BAIER: Senator Klobuchar, we appreciate your time. I'm heading to Iowa tomorrow.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: OK.</p><p>BAIER: We will see when you get.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: We'll see if I'm there. You may beat me there, but I plan on being there at least by Sunday.</p><p>BAIER: OK, Senator, thanks for your time.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you.</p><p>BAIER: The impeachment saga seems to be winding down, as we talked about. The presidential primary season about to begin. We will talk about it with the panel when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Whether you decide to hear witnesses and relevant testimony, the facts will come out in the end. In all of their horror, they will come out.</p><p>PATRICK PHILBIN, TRUMP IMPEACHMENT ATTORNEY: This is the very epitome of a partisan impeachment. There was bipartisan opposition to it in the House. The Senate is not here to do the investigatory work that the House didn't do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: And in the end senators agreed with that 51 to 49, voting against witnesses. One of the key votes, Lisa Murkowski from Alaska, Republican, said ""I carefully considered the need for additional witnesses and documents to cure the shortcomings of its process, but ultimately decided that I will vote against considering motions to subpoena. I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate. I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed. It has also become clear some of my colleagues intend to further politicize this process and drag the Supreme Court into the fray, while attacking the Chief Justice. I will not stand for nor support that effort."" That's a reference to Elizabeth Warren and her question that Chief Justice Roberts read as presiding officer.</p><p>Let's bring in our panel, Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the ""Washington Free Beacon,"" Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the ""Washington Examiner,"" and Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for ""Reuters."" Jeff, your thoughts on where we are and where we may be going here?</p><p>JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, REUTERS: Just picking up on the discussion of while Amy Klobuchar was on the air with you, I think it's important to realize that it's still early in terms of what the political ramifications of all of this will be. Clearly, she doesn't want the impeachment process to have hurt her in a place like Iowa. But the bigger question is, will it hurt Democrats in November? Will it help President Trump in November? His campaign believes so far that it's helping him. They have economic numbers to verify that in terms of their fundraising.</p><p>But there is still a lot that can happen in this election between now and November in terms of how it settles down and whether some people who may be on the fence about President Trump will look back that the impeachment and think, hey, that's raised some questions, or whether that base that is so strengthened by this and has come out of this will then show up in greater numbers.</p><p>BAIER: It is a long time from now until November, so we will see how that sits. From colleagues on board Air Force One, senior administration officials saying after the vote happened the reaction was calm but pleased, nothing like applause or cheering but a recognition that things are clearly going in the right direction.</p><p>Matthew, to Jeff's point about things coming out, obviously today you had the ""New York Times"" with this headline about John Bolton, another section of this book, we're told, where he says that the president told him in May to kind of pave the way for this meeting between Rudy Giuliani and Ukraine's leader. Joe Biden reacted to that and about impeachment. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not surprised. I didn't know that but I'm not surprised. I find it kind of amazing that serious constitutional lawyers would suggest that it's OK, it's OK to seek the help of a foreign government to interfere in an election on behalf of the sitting president by threatening to withhold aid.</p><p>It is not a partisan impeachment. He violated the Constitution, period.</p><p>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: Only Democrats voted for it in the House and one independent.</p><p>BIDEN: Well, that doesn't mean that the facts, the underlying facts, George, whether the Constitution has been violated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: But, as far as the votes, it was pretty partisan.</p><p>MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, ""WASHINGTON FREE BEACON"": Yes. Biden doesn't know what he is talking about there. Look at this politically. When Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry, Donald Trump's approval rating in the RCP, Real Clear Politics average, is the same as it was today. If you look at Biden's numbers, his unfavorable rating has spiked, and his margin in the head-to-head in September, he was beating Donald Trump by double digits. Now he has a slim, under five-point lead in many polls. This has hurt Joe Biden. It is not too early for us to talk about the political consequences.</p><p>BAIER: I tried to ask that to Amy Klobuchar. She deftly dodged it. But pretty soon there is going to be some efforts, I think, to separate once you get through Iowa and New Hampshire.</p><p>FERRECHIO: There is 1,000 news cycles between right now and the November election. And getting through this whole primary process, I have a feeling we are going to be talking about something completely different. The Clinton impeachment ultimately was a net loss for Republicans who instigated it. So there's a fear, of course, amongst Republicans that the same impact for them, for their House seats, for the Senate races, for their efforts to win White House, that they're just going to be seen as partisans trying to stop this president.</p><p>But they are also trying to do a lot of political damage for Trump. And they have dinged him, no question, with all these allegations. There will be more drip, drip, drip coming out with the book manuscript. We don't have that yet. Eventually the whole book will be out and we'll all be able to read it. I don't see this ending. I think this is going to just plague Trump's first term all the way up to the --</p><p>BAIER: It may be a slow burn. You've got the book. You have got the decision on McGahn, the former White House counsel, of whether he is going to testify on Capitol Hill. You have the Supreme Court taking up the case about the president's tax returns at the end of March. So, you are right, Susan. Here is the president talking to Peter Doocy about his potential competition.</p><p>I don't have his ear. But let me tell you what he said. He said that I'm leading everybody in Iowa. He goes on to talk about mini-Mike did a very poor job in that last term. He was terrible. And he goes down the list, including Joe. And he says that Bernie is surging.</p><p>For Republicans, they would like to see Bernie win in Iowa and New Hampshire and wherever else he can, right?</p><p>MASON: I think. I think that that's reflected in the fact that President Trump has been talking a lot about Bernie and saying that maybe the Democrats and the DNC is trying to rig the system against Bernie again. He would like to have somebody up there on the stage who he can say very clearly without any challenges to him, I'm running against a socialist, because Bernie Sanders identifies as a democratic socialist. And one of the biggest applause lines that President Donald Trump gets rallies and elsewhere is when he says under my watch, we're not going to become a socialist country.</p><p>BAIER: And that's what's going to play out over the next couple weeks really, couple months.</p><p>CONTINETTI: If Bernie wins Iowa, he is already very well-positioned in New Hampshire. That will set the Democratic Party on fire. And that's why I think you have had this rule change to allow Mike Bloomberg into the debates. This is their insurance policy if the Biden campaign collapses.</p><p>BAIER: I should point out that Elizabeth Warren tweeted that she is very opposed to this rule change, shouldn't allow changes for billionaires, she says. Thanks, panel. We'll take to you Miami for a report on Super Bowl security next.</p><p>BAIER: We are just two days away from the Super Bowl, which you can see on the FOX broadcast network on Sunday, big FOX. It's Kansas City versus San Francisco, of course, on the field. But the effort off the field to keep everyone safe, just as intense. Correspondent Phil Keating shows us from Miami.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: As far as NORAD and the Department of Homeland Security is concerned, the safest place this super Sunday will be around Miami. Pilot Alex Edwards flew me on board an Interview Guard F- 15 warplane, pulling serious g's with every maneuver.</p><p>NORAD is enforcing the 30-mile no-fly zone around Hard Rock Stadium on game day. The priority, keeping bad intent away from the game and the huge crowd. To simulate, we intercepted a small Cessna playing the role of a small plane full of explosives head to the Super Bowl.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Simulating, no response.</p><p>KEATING: In this drill, the bad guy refused to land, and that's the biggest fear for Edwards.</p><p>ALEX EDWARDS, PILOT: Fear, I say, never really wanting to have to go that far, but if it ever comes to it, we have trained for it. We prepare for it. We have our rules of engagement, if it comes to that, to execute.</p><p>KEATING: Customs and Border Protection is also heavily involved with their armed Blackhawk helicopters and their Go-fast boats up and down Biscayne Bay. They simulated an on-the-water intercept of a boat with bad guys posing a threat entering the no boating zones. Facing big guns and shoutout engines, they gave up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hands up!</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KEATING: Also here at the stadium, x-ray trucks scanning every vehicle and cargo container entering the footprint. Everyone very well aware that if a bad actor wants to make a big international splash, it will be here at the biggest global event, Super Bowl Sunday. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Phil, thank you.</p><p>Finally tonight, ""Notable Quotables.""</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're not going to be able to joke at his Hall of Fame ceremony. Those are the ones you can't get back.</p><p>TRUMP: We're finally ending the NAFTA nightmare.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Two new trade deals, two Supreme Court justices, two dead terrorists. That's two terms.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump is the smart one. You all elitists are dumb.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: That was a good one. I needed that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know you want to ban our national flags, but we are going to wave you goodbye.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Put your flags away. You're leaving. And take them with you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is Hunter Biden a relevant witness, senator?</p><p>SEN. JOE MANCHIN, (D-WV): I think so. I really do.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you lower the bar that way -- danger, danger, danger.</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have got to stop building and replacing pipelines.</p><p>BIDEN: Go vote for someone else.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I like Mike.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I like Mike. I lick Mike.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chiefs or 49ers.</p><p>TRUMP: I do have a feeling as to who is going to win, but I'm not going to say it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: One week. Just getting word, final vote Wednesday.</p><p>This weekend, ""FOX News Sunday"" is in Miami. Chris Wallace will interview Trump impeachment attorney Alan Dershowitz. Check your local listings for show times.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid. ""The Story"" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right after the break. We are heading to Des Moines, Iowa, for the Iowa caucuses, but we have got you covered. We know the process now.

I'll be interviewing the President, first interview since all the events. We'll always be fair, balanced, never the media mob. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham is next from Miami. We'll see you on Super Bowl Sunday. Have a great weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is The Ingraham Angle, not from Miami tonight. We're in Washington, where all the action is. Come on, Hannity. Well, now that they've lost their witness vote, Democrats still can't let go.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Senator Mike Ron and Congressman Meadows and Jordan have reaction and Mollie Hemingway and Ari Fleischer are here tonight. They're going to explain how the Democrats stunts, these last-minute little tricks in their bag have turned the public against Washington even more if that's possible. And Raymond Arroyo brings you an impeachment themed Friday Follies. Schiff and Nadler's big crackup and Schumer's Kamala crackdown. This is a fun one. But first, the real bitter clingers. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.</p><p>Now remember when Obama described us conservatives as bitter people, clinging to our guns and our religion. Well now we see who the real bitter clingers really are. Schiff, Schumer, Nadler, Pelosi, Romney, Bolton, just to name a few.</p><p>Well, all of them when you think about it in their own way are very angry people. They cling reflexively to an ideology that most people just don't relate to anymore. Now the Democrats have become increasingly rabid and radical. They're turning off most sane people. Bolton though he's a poster child for the neo con Never Trump crowd, still fantasizing about the glory days of deploying 100,000 troops for nation building in Iraq. Both Left and Right have rejected his intervention as worldview. Yet somehow, he landed the NSC job at the Trump White House. Go figure.</p><p>Well fortunate for us, President Trump was too smart to fall for all that nonsense. A blank check for any country claiming to be an ally with a hand stretched out, not the Trump doctrine maybe. And as for Mitt, can I get a witness Romney. Well, he's bitter too.</p><p>He still can't believe someone of his pedigree and upbringing ever lost the presidency and that a man like Trump won it. 2012 is over Mitt. Don't punish Trump or the rest of us for your own weakness as a candidate.</p><p>Now, last night, I titled the Angle 24 hours to victory. Love that font. Well that title is correct though because Trump today triumphed over the unfair, unjust and politically motivated witch hunt. But the Democrats cannot accept defeat as we've told you time and again when they lose, they call everything that happened before illegitimate. But now even the liberal media, well they're having a hard time spinning it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump won. He's going to win this trial. He won on the issue of witnesses. He's going to get acquitted. That's how history will remember what went on here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's over. They lost. Trump won. Toobin even has to admit it. So, let's move on. But no that would be the gracious thing to do. Instead the Democrats are dragging it out in a pathetic attempt to cast a pall over Trump State of the Union address and to gratuitously ruin Super Bowl weekend for the rest of us.</p><p>Oh, the Iowa caucuses. Who cares about those now? Sure, the gang are deeply bitter selfish and self-aggrandizing people. They're bitter once again because Trump has beaten them at their own game and once again, Mitch McConnell, that's sly wily old dog in the Senate outmaneuvered all of them. And once again, some of the radicals in their party are just repelling the public and the support of key senators, they needed.</p><p>Senator Murkowski was so turned off by Elizabeth Warren stunt demeaning the Chief Justice with a question last night that she rejected witnesses because of it. She wrote, I will not stand for nor support that effort.</p><p>So, while Chuck and Adam tilt at windmills, President Trump what has he done. Well, he's chocked up some fantastic victories this week. The USMCA and a bold Middle East peace plan to name a couple and his administration as managing a global contagion that is threatening lives and international markets. He also signed an executive order to dismantle some of the world's worst criminal enterprises.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My administration is fighting these monsters, persecuting and prosecuting them and locking them away for a very, very long time. We are dismantling the criminal organizations that make large scale human trafficking possible</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: But the political games are not over, not by a long shot. Now I warned you the other night that the Democrats and the media would drop one shiny object after another, and they do it in front of us as an attempt to kind of drag this out as long as possible. Julie Swetnick is somewhere waiting in the wings. And right on cue, of course, the New York Times conveniently dropped another 11th hour exclusive fed by sources who claim to have read John Bolton's unpublished manuscript.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The significance of this can't be understated. Bolton seems to implicate all of the players.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Suddenly there is new information that involves Pat Cipollone actually being in a room where supposedly some of this happens.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It absolutely disgust me. This is essentially the end of clue. The butler did it in the Oval Office with a match.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, it's obvious to anyone with a pulse that this is nothing more than a calculated, anonymously sourced hit job, it's a last-ditch attempt to sway fence sitting senators. But Adam Schiff wants you to believe it as gospel.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): You will recall Mr. Cipollone suggesting that the House managers were concealing facts from this body. He said all the facts should come out. Well, there's a new fact which indicates that Mr. Cipollone was among those who were in the loop. Just as we predicted, and it didn't require any great act of clairvoyance. The facts would come out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Oh, never mind that the President has already issued a blanket statement saying the meeting never happened. So, Schiff is going to do anything though to keep this hustle alive. What else does he have? Even if it means tarnishing the reputations of good men like Pat Cipollone.</p><p>Now, Schiff knows he's lost, and he knows that he and all the Democrats are grasping at it and claim no matter how tenuous the string to fake this impeachment. Keep it going. Keep it going. Keep it going. Chuck Schumer, by the way, is already refusing to accept the results of the next election unless, of course, something happens between now and Wednesday. And Trump is just removed from office.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): If this President is interfering in the elections, the elections may not have a fair result. Very few people doubt that he would do it again and again and again. He's already tried several times.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: He's done it several does. This from a man, by the way, who supports striking Trump's name from the ballot in November while forcing major candidates in his own party off the campaign trail just days before the Iowa caucuses.</p><p>And Trump is the one interfering with the elections? No, Chuck, it's you and Schiff and the entire Democrat gang, who are putting your fingers on the scale for the Democrat establishment. Good luck. But the American people see right through you. And that's the Angle.</p><p>All right. Joining me now is Sol Wisenberg, Former Deputy Independent Counsel. Also, with me is Gregg Jarrett, Fox News Legal Analyst. Gregg let's start with you. We thought and yet we knew there was going to be something that happened today. We all predicted it last night, even though Trump won, Toobin had to say, look, it's over. We won. They won. But what sorts of stunts could the Democrats pull between now and that Wednesday vote?</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, they're relying on The New York Times. This is impeachment by The New York Times based on anonymous hearsay, multiple hearsay witnesses who actually haven't read Bolton's book.</p><p>Look, even if you assume that President Trump, for the sake of argument, wanted a quid pro quo to investigate the Biden's, it's still not an impeachable offense because the President had a legitimate public interest reason to ask Ukraine to look into the Biden's conduct and anybody seriously argue that Joe and Hunter Biden's conduct here isn't objectively suspicious and warranted an investigation by any reasonable standard. It did.</p><p>This is a kid who's making a million bucks a year in exchange for nothing with no expertise. And then a father threatening to extort a billion dollars from Ukraine to fire the investigator in Ukraine who's investigating Hunter Biden's company in what really hurt them the most was when the Democrats own witnesses video clips were played in which they were saying they had serious concerns about what Hunter and Joe Biden were doing and reporter clips, raising questions about potential corruption by the FBI.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. Well, we're going to learn more about that. They're going to be having oversight hearings. This is the beginning, not the end. Lindsey Graham has had a judiciary. But you're going to see foreign relations and others involved.</p><p>Sol, the President's legal team called out this common line that we keep hearing from the Democrats throughout the trial.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY SEKULOW, TRUMP DEFENSE TEAM: You did hear evidence. You heard evidence from 13 different witnesses. 192 video clips over 28,000 pages of documents. You heard testimony from Gordon Sondland testified in the House proceedings. I did not have an opportunity to cross-examination - to cross- examine him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Sol, was that a good case?</p><p>SOL WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Well, that particular point was a very good point, because you're talking about - the House managers are talking about not being able to call witnesses. There are a number in the trial. There are no problems with that. But it's very important that the President was not invited. Remember, the President and his lawyers were not invited until it got to the House Judiciary Committee with Nadler and the game was over by then, they'd already announced no more witnesses. So, I think that particular point was outstanding.</p><p>The bigger point to me is, you know, impeachment is a serious business. If you're going to do it, don't make it a joke. Don't make it political. Don't authorize the inquiry with a press conference. Dot your eyes. Cross your T's. Be serious. It was so obviously political that people really could not focus on the substantive - the substantive complaints about him. And because of that, they had no credibility.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I think so many people tuned out on the other networks. You think that was going to be their big glory day, but their ratings kind of went like this and ours kept going like that, which is nice for us, but it's bad for the country. Now, the media, Greg is joining in on this, Schiff's smear courtesy of The New York Times of the lead counsel for the White House, Pat Cipollone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was so rigged that the man right here defending him was in the room when Trump extorter Ukraine.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If he is in a meeting in May where he hears this plan and then he stands up as a lawyer in a tribunal and says the opposite argument as a fact witness, that is - you lose your law license, stuff like that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cipollone is in a hornet's nest of legal ethics issues right now as an attorney.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: I mean Gregg, the great thing about this is Adam Schiff is a fact witness. He shouldn't have been leading the House managers.</p><p>JARRETT: Yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But this attack comes from this New York Times leak from someone who saw a manuscript by John Bolton. But it's clearly just meant to distract from, again, from Schiff's own conflict as a fact witness.</p><p>JARRETT: Oh, absolutely. And look, Adam Schiff has done everything he possibly can to cover up his own collusion, if you will, with a whistleblower in creating a pretext to trigger this whole impeachment proceedings. And did anybody honestly believe Adam Schiff when he said on the Senate floor, Oh, I don't know the identity of the whistleblower. Of course, he did.</p><p>The other amusing part was Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer saying, oh, this isn't a real trial and it's not a real acquittal because there were no witnesses. There were more than a dozen witnesses that were introduced and accepted into evidence and video clips played for the jurors, the senators of their testimony, and more than 28,000 pages of documents introduced as evidence. It is folly to argue that this is somehow an illegitimate trial. The only thing that was illegitimate was the impeachment in the House, in which fundamental due process was deprived for the president.</p><p>INGRAHAM: There was a moment tonight Sol where Jake Tapper was again dangling the shiny objects to the viewers on CNN, echoing what we've heard over the last several days and different iterations about why this acquittal that's coming up on Wednesday will not really be legitimate. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: Is striking that there is a national security adviser for President Trump, John Bolton, who is out there basically waving his hands and saying, I would like to be subpoenaed. I would like to testify. You have the President's former Chief of Staff, John Kelly, talking to people, saying, I think that the Senate should call new witnesses. I believe John Bolton, even if President Trump denies this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, Sol, what's preventing John Bolton from giving an interview with Jake Tapper? They seem like they agree on a lot. And John Kelly wasn't even in the White House during the entire Ukraine saga.</p><p>WISENBERG: The John Kelly thing is just hilarious to me, why all of a sudden, this John Kelly, you know, the authority on impeachment and removal. I mean, he couldn't even be a fact witness in this case. And as we've talked about several times on the show, they didn't want to call John Bolton as a witness in the House. They didn't even subpoena him. And when it looked like the judge was going to make a ruling on the Kupperman case, which Bolton said, I'll follow, they withdraw, withdrew their subpoena. I'm not sure why they did it.</p><p>But I'll tell you something about whether or not it's legitimate. Just like Nancy Pelosi said, he's impeached forever. He's acquitted forever. And I want to point out one other thing that's incorrect that's being said repeatedly. The Democratic senators are saying that there's never been an impeachment without witnesses. That is not true. The very first impeachment ever in our history had no witnesses. It was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, which is what a lot of the president supporters wanted to do with this. So, even that isn't accurate.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I wanted it to be dismissed out of hand. Right off the top. But they didn't have the votes for it.</p><p>WISENBERG: You did.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Gentlemen, it's been so much fun, you know, enduring this with you. But I know we'll probably have you back next week. I can't say goodbye but have a great weekend. Enjoy the Super Bowl.</p><p>All right. We all know that Trump is going to be acquitted. It's going to happen on Wednesday. But what's the point now? What has been the point of all of this? It's a political stunt to keep it going. Democrats clearly to blame here. But what's their motivation, the real motivation to not do what they could have done today and get it into the Iowa caucuses? The State of the Union, those two things are happening in Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at The Federalist. Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary. Both Fox News Contributors. Mollie, they don't trust their own primary voters, do they? To pick whoever they want. The Iowa caucuses, they're keeping a lot of people in town.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: It's a follow-up of the entire operation of not trusting voters. Nobody ever thought that this impeachment would ever lead to the removal of the President. It was always about affecting voters. Thoughts about the president.</p><p>Likewise, there seems to be a lot of concern in the Democratic Party about the rise of Bernie Sanders. And there are some drastic measures that people are trying to take to prevent his rise and just a high degree of meddling there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And by the way, Michael Moore - we can't even play the clip tonight because he went absolutely ballistic. And I believe it was in Iowa saying that the establishment in the Democrat Party and basically and I'm putting their finger on the scale against the upstart candidates. But Ari, Schiff, I think demonstrated - he never really gave up his dream of being a Hollywood screenwriter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHIFF: There was a storm blowing through this capital. Its winds are strong, and they move us in uncertain and dangerous directions. If we have faith that the ship of state can survive the truth, this storm shall pass.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's the screenwriting for dummies here, I mean. The blowhards may be blowing through the gap at all. Ari, this was a sad moment, even by Adam Schiff standards.</p><p>ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I was going to wipe a tear from my eye listening to that beautiful oration. But Laura, what scares me here, when you talk about Schiff and what his next move might be is the House Intelligence Committee, a very important committee for our national security. Historically, a non-partisan committee has now been turned into the House Permanent Committee on impeachment, and they're not going to give up.</p><p>I think they're chastened. They realize they went too - well, they don't realize they went too far. But the American people do. I would not be surprised if Adam Schiff tries to pick up this mantle and run another impeachment through the House in the next year or two, if he hears another witness, if we hear somebody else to say it. They can't resist this temptation.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, what else are they going to do? Actually govern? I mean work with - containing this coronavirus or infrastructure, prescription drug. I mean, they're just - they're not serious people. And Mollie, MSNBC's Chris Hayes tried to spin today's vote as kind of a bittersweet victory for the GOP.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: Kavanaugh, I think was mobilizing for many Republicans, even ones who don't like Trump. I know them. I've talked to them. I don't think this is mobilizing for people who for Republicans who don't like Trump. I don't think that witness vote particularly is a good vote.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I wouldn't take Chris Hayes view on these things for how Republicans--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Look at the crowds, this is the crowds that showed up for Trump lining up in New Jersey, Wildwood, New Jersey, biggest crowd they've ever had for an event other than a rock concert. Huge event, huge event in Des Moines. Look at these crowds. I mean, Trump maybe exaggerate some of the crowds at times. But these were massive crowds.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, and just this was what was such an unforced error from Democrats. Donald Trump does well when he has a foil, when he can say that people are unfairly going after him, which dragging out an impeachment process, which just never, ever caught sway outside of the resistance just helps him completely.</p><p>I love the Kavanaugh mentioned though, because I think also what the Left hasn't figured out is that by doing the Kavanaugh smear operation, they kind of ruined all future operations like that where the media and the Democrats walk hand-in-hand as they carefully deploy information and they put out supposed bombshells.</p><p>They did that with Kavanaugh. They did that for years with the Russia hoax. And people are not stupid. They woke up to it. Now, when they hear that something's going on. They almost expect to hear some bombshell that turns out not to be a bombshell. Rather than taking it seriously when the media and the Democrats work hand-in-hand for a shared political goal.</p><p>INGRAHAM: So, Ari, that's a great point. I think that people are onto this, they're pretty smart. They sense that this is all kind of a smash and grab job, smear and slash, whatever you want to call it. And it gets old and tiresome. This is Super Bowl weekend and we've got some fun events coming up. Iowa caucuses, you got the State of the Union speech. People want to get on with their lives, but they are bitter, and they are clinging, and they want to take everybody else down with them.</p><p>FLEISCHER: And they are liberal. In 1994, only 25 percent of the Democrats self-identified as liberals. Today, according to Gallup, 51 percent of Democrats self-identify as liberals. And that's why we have impeachment.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi tried to hold that storm back and then she got over flooded. She couldn't control the AOC wing of the Democrat Party. And now you're seeing in Iowa with Bernie Sanders, aren't you? You're seeing in New Hampshire; you're seeing in California. The Democratic Party is fundamentally a different party than it was even one generation ago when Bill Clinton was President.</p><p>And this is the Democrats kiss of death. This is where they are turning moderates who don't necessarily like Donald Trump into Trump voters because the Democrats have gone too far, are too angry, and they're just no moderates, reasonable Democrats left.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Anything just to stop the winds blowing through the capital speech again. Anything to stop that. Mollie and Ari have a great weekend. We'll see you soon. Up ahead with likely Wednesday acquittal on the schedule. What dirty tricks are the GOP expecting? They have some ideas and they're joining us next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID JOLLY, FORMER FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN: Donald Trump wanted the full acquittal, the Republicans were going to cheer him, and they'll still cheer him, but it softens both sides on Tuesday night. Donald Trump will be still sitting awaiting the final verdict in the Senate. He can't take a legitimate victory lap Tuesday night.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Is he and Jeff Flake should take their show on the road. Wouldn't that be a fun duo? Well, on the truth does come out, doesn't it, Democrats will do anything to hurt the President, no matter how petty. And it's because they know Trump is going to win in the end. His acquittal on Wednesday is a virtual certainty at this point.</p><p>But what can we expect in the meantime? Joining us now with some ideas, Congressman Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, both of members of Trump's defense team. Along with me is Indiana Senator Mike Braun, Senator Braun. Please explain for the audience what we might expect between now and Monday. Now, Wednesday. We know there's going to be arguments on Monday, but there seems to be this continuum with the media dropping a little shiny sparkler and the politicos running toward it and saying, bombshell, we need witnesses.</p><p>SEN. MIKE BRAUN (R-IN): We could have had it all done in compressed other than for Chuck Schumer. So, what he wants to do in the meantime is milk the time between the vote today, which was clear he was going to lose that, and they wanted time. I think also to get their presidential candidates back to Iowa and then come back on Monday.</p><p>Monday, there'll be final arguments Tuesday at time for individual senators to make a floor speech and then Wednesday, the vote. You know, I've been here not a long time, but that's the essence of what we've got. And that was what took an hour and 15 minutes to figure out.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But literally, no one wants to hear from any of you. God bless you. We love you. You're a wonderful person. We don't want to hear from you. We don't care about what Susan Collins does about. We don't care about what you know that any of you guys. Murkowski. I'm glad they're getting through this. This is not a therapy session, Congressman Meadows, but this is only in Washington. Do senators or congressmen think, oh, the people are just desperate to hear from us one more time. No one knows how to say goodbye in this town.</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC): Well, you're exactly right. You've hit the nail on the head. What most of America wants is for the President to be about business that actually affects them. And guess what? He has been. We've signed in the USMCA this week. You know, if you look at what happened 16 blocks from here, they're tuning us out and tuning to him because he's actually delivering on his campaign promises.</p><p>So, you're exactly right. Listen, Wednesday will come. Wednesday will go. And what will happen in the meantime, we'll see a continuation of politics. We've seen it for the last several days on the Senate floor.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's unbelievable.</p><p>MEADOWS: With Adam Schiff, politics day in, day out. And what are we doing, we're taking a break. So, a few of them can go politic in Iowa.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But they could have gotten it done today. This all could've been wrapped up today. My Angle was called the real bitter clingers because they're bitter people. They're clinging to what - Mitt's clinging to 2012. And 10 percent of America thought he was going to beat Obama. OK. And the other people are bitter because Trump always outmaneuvers them. And McConnell does as well. McConnell's handled this.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Sure has.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Brilliantly, I mean, incredibly. But there was a moment today where one of your old pals, Andy McCabe was on CNN and he was talking about conspiracies. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW MCCABE, ATTORNEY: Beyond the problems that it may cause Mr. Cipollone in terms of his own bar license. He could be facing some sort of inquiry or as a fact witness, you could really make a strong argument that he should have recused himself from representing the president under these circumstances. If this was a conspiracy, he was a co-conspirator.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Andrew McCabe referencing an anonymously sourced ""New York Times"" article.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): It's laughable because the two guys on either side of Mr. Cuomo both were under investigation by the Justice Department. Andy McCabe lied three times under oath and was fired at the FBI. Andy McCabe, Jim Baker was on the other side of Mr. Cuomo. Jim Comey, Lisa Page, and Peter Strzok ran the Clinton investigation, the Trump-Russia investigation, all of them fired, demoted, and left the FBI.</p><p>These are the top people. This is what Bill Barr said, the upper echelon of the FBI, there was a failure of leadership there. That is the understatement of the year, and yet he is on here lecturing Pat Cipollone, who just did a great job defending the president? That would be laughable if it wasn't so --</p><p>INGRAHAM: He is one of the most ethical, credible people in Washington. Everybody knows --</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC): So guess what you get to be if you're under indictment with the FBI and you're part of that top, you get to be a contributor on CNN.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Exactly. What is your talent? You actually lied under oath. Senator Braun, Democrats in the media today were declaring the death of the GOP.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): I think it is a sad day for the so-called Republican Party. They are going to need to find their souls.</p><p>CARL BERNSTEIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Republican leadership and membership has now joined hands with a tyrant.</p><p>EUGENE ROBINSON, COLUMNIST, ""WASHINGTON POST"": A Trump-ist party, which is not the Republican Party that you joined years ago, and as I recall, from five years ago. It needs to be removed from positions of authority and power.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: He just said it needs to be removed. They are not in favor of a representative democracy. They don't like the people having their say, Senator Braun.</p><p>SEN. MIKE BRAUN (R-IN): They won't let up. I talked to the president the day after the Bolton stuff surfaced, and I told him, when we get through this, which we will, we are going to have this all the way until November, 2020. At the tail end of that Q and A the other day, which that was 16 hours of repetition, because Dershowitz did a good job of talking about political interest, public interest, and personal interest. So we teed up a question that said, how does what they put the president through compare to the Bidens? And that was really a quid pro quo. And of course, that got caught in terms of cutting to the bone, to the marrow. And of course it got commented by WAPO and ""New York Magazine,"" and Lee and I did that.</p><p>So we can't lay low, because they are going to do this all the way through November of 2020. That is when that final verdict would come in, when the people have their say, and I think they're going to be surprised.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Do you think, Congressman Meadows, that some of this is also being done to save the Democrat establishment candidate in Iowa who is having some trouble? Joe Biden is struggling right now. And the rise of Bernie Sanders is undeniable. They kept people in town for a long time and even over the weekend. They are not going to be going in full gear. This has been a long week for a lot of people. What about that?</p><p>MEADOWS: If there's one thing I know, it's Washington, D.C., loves to control who is going to be in control. And when you see that, this is all about politics, Bernie Sanders is a threat to the way that Washington, D.C., does it on their side. Donald Trump is the great disruptor, and yet what he continues to do is show that if you are willing to drain the swamp, the swamp will always fight back. That's what we're seeing.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Swamp monsters.</p><p>MEADOWS: But what we are also seeing is a State of the Union address that is going to be sandwiched by two days of rhetoric that don't matter. And so the state of the union will actually show a vision of what we can accomplish in the year to come.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Congressman Meadows, you and I have talked about this related to the Mueller investigation, the spying on Carter Page, the fake FISA warrant, Congressman Jordan, and also, of course, on what happened to Brett Kavanaugh. No one ever seems to pay for what they do to the country. And we have a whistle-blower that really wasn't a whistle-blower. We have an I.G. whose transcript we have never seen. And we have a guy who collaborated in some way, shape, or form with the so-called whistle-blower. We don't really know what happened in that office. Who pays here? Does anyone ever pay?</p><p>JORDAN: Let's hope so. Let's hope that the Durham investigation leads to someone being held accountable. But here's the good news, the president is going to be acquitted, and he's going to be acquitted, he's going to win but win stronger than anyone predicted. When Nancy Pelosi started this on September 24th no one would've predicted that every single Republican would have voted against the article of impeachment, one Democrat would vote with us, another Democrat would vote with us on one of the articles, a third Democrat voted present, and a fourth Democrat voted with us and then switched parties.</p><p>And what is going to happen next Wednesday? A bipartisan majority in the United States Senate are going to vote to acquit the presidents. So his victory will be stronger than anyone in this town, all the conventional wisdom said back in September. That is the good news. And so in spite of all this, no one being held accountable, the president is going to win and he's going to win much bigger than anyone thought.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Acquitted forever.</p><p>BRAUN: And then the agenda is going to take over because that is working so well. I came here for that reason. It's working on main street, and when you look at the crazy stuff that Bernie is talking about, that Biden now has to talk about --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Grab your wallet, my friends. Grab your wallet, hide your pets.</p><p>BRAUN: We're going to win for several reasons.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Hide your pets. And I understand that you were put out there because you were out a lot on television, more so that you've been, because you were reassuring to people. And I just want to say I do find Indiana very reassuring. Every time I go there the people are very reassuring.</p><p>BRAUN: It's the crossroads of America.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And you are very reassuring.</p><p>BRAUN: Thank you, and I'll continue to be so.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And I loved having you all on in the last few weeks, and we'll talk to you next week, I'm sure. But thanks so much, guys.</p><p>And coming up, Adam Schiff and Chuck Schumer have trouble keeping their minions in line? And has the Senate chaplain gone rogue? Raymond Arroyo must be here, and it must be Friday Follies, next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's Friday, it means time for Friday Follies, an impeachment edition. Joining us with all the details, Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor. Raymond, you saw a moment at the trial last night that told a bigger story.</p><p>RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It did. When the final questions came, Laura, for the House prosecutors, Jerry Nadler moved as fast as he has ever moved to answer, even when lead manager Adam Schiff tried to stop him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE: Any other comments the Senate would benefit from hearing before we adjourn for the evening?</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.</p><p>REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Senate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Jerry, Jerry, Jerry. It reminded me of another team that also kind of fell apart, had a big falling out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, that's all I ask. No, listen to me. I just want to know, was that hard? I just want to know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Raymond, Raymond, Raymond.</p><p>ARROYO: Both these Jerrys had enough of that Schiff, OK. What happened here, you'll remember, Nancy Pelosi is really to blame for this animosity of these men. Jerry Nadler as head of the Judiciary committee, he should have been the first prime mover of impeachment. She put her friend and her accomplice Schiff to lead not only the impeachment, but to guide the hearing.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He wanted to be Schiff-less.</p><p>ARROYO: And then you remember, when Nadler got up, he made those horrible comments to the senators, saying this is a torturous vote, traitorous vote. That set off alarms. And then the Nadler hustle may have been payback for this moment at a presser last week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Nadler, Mr. Nadler, the Republicans have been going --</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): I'm going to respond to the questions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Nadler has been criticized by Republicans, Mr. Schiff.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: I'm going to respond to the questions, and Nadler had to just sit back and take it. Let me tell you, it didn't matter whether Schiff or Nadler led this thing, or who was driving the bus, there wasn't enough gas to get it where they wanted it to go. It's over. But it shows the tension and the animosity.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And I noticed there is something about Adam Schiff when he gets a little bit exercised about something. His eyes, he does the Marty Feldman eyes thing.</p><p>ARROYO: The eyes distend a little bit. But we've got to move on, Laura.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Since impeachment began, the media has taken up the Democrat line, and they're trying to characterize the proceedings this way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Any other comments the Senate would benefit from hearing before we adjourn for the evening?</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF, (D-CA) CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.</p><p>JERROLD NADLER, (D-NY) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Senate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: That was the wrong bite. It was actually, they were talking about this being a solemn, serious occasion. I'm not sure Senator Kamala Harris got the memo. Watch Chuck Schumer's reaction when Kamala was a little less than solemn and serious.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you view it as at least a partial victory that you have a Republican like -- I will start again. Do you view it as at least a partial victory --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Start again when everybody is solemn.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Let's cut that out. I'm surprised Kamala didn't break into that -- remember how she did that dance tape?</p><p>ARROYO: A little song and dance routine?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, that dance tape.</p><p>ARROYO: The Bob Marley routine.</p><p>Laura, there was a moment that, frankly, it made me pretty sad when I watched this. The Senate Chaplain, Barry Black, opened the Senate trial with this prayer. Listen closely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARRY BLACK, SENATE CHAPLAIN: Remind our senators that they alone are accountable to you for their conduct. Lord help them to remember that they can't ignore you and get away with it, for we always reap what we sow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: If you're going to condemn people and raise the judgment of god to them, don't do it over a partisan thing like this impeachment. This is divisive. He should be bringing people together. I'm sorry, I think the chaplain went above and beyond his authority here.</p><p>INGRAHAM: There were a number of prayers, there were a number of prayers - - you felt like it was --</p><p>ARROYO: He said earlier in the week the trial will make the nation stronger, wiser, and better. How? Raise your moral voice for things that matter -- abortion, religious liberty. That's where his conscience --</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right, Raymond, before we go, they say a picture is worth 1,000 words.</p><p>ARROYO: Yes, they do.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But is it really the case? Do we see the faces of what it all looks like at the end?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>ARROYO: Oh, so sad. This was after the Senate voted, Laura, no witnesses. Very dejected.</p><p>INGRAHAM: She looks happy. Imagine having a drink with her tonight.</p><p>ARROYO: Won't you help this anchor?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM: This is like a save the children ad.</p><p>ARROYO: You know the old factory line, Laura, the world is a looking glass and gives back to every man what his face shows? God help some of these folks, I hope they have happier days.</p><p>INGRAHAM: When we return, the Democrats' conspiracy trick. Solomon and Lee Smith explain in moments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): You've heard about the Adam Schiff is the root of all evil conspiracy theory. You've heard about the Burisma conspiracy theory, the whistle-blower conspiracy theory.</p><p>MAX BOOT, SENIOR FELLOW, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: Retelling these discredited old conspiracy theories that have been investigated time and again and have been found to be groundless.</p><p>REP. JASON CROW (D-CO): These widely debunked Russian propaganda conspiracy theories about Burisma and Ukrainian involvement in the election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's a nice trick, isn't it? It's so obvious, though. The left has played this trick relentlessly in the age of Trump. If the facts are inconvenient, just say they are all conspiracies.</p><p>Joining us now, two investigative journalists, Lee Smith, author of ""The Plot Against The President,"" and John Solomon, FOX News contributor. John, they are willing to take every leak at face value, yet ignore the rank corruption in their midst. What gives here?</p><p>JOHN SOLOMON, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: It was the story of Russia, right? The built the Russia collusion on 1,000 leaks that turned out not to be true, right? And the greatest conspiracy theory foisted upon the American people was the Russian collusion story brought to you by the same crowd that just gave us the impeachment trial.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And they just kept repeating, though, during the impeachment trial and during Senate trial, they just kept going over and over, conspired with Russia, the Kremlin is happy. How many times did you see that?</p><p>SOLOMON: Too many for the facts, that is for sure.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Lee, again, this is what we've come to expect from the Democrats. When Adam Schiff was asked about Mr. Misko and his staff and the movement with the whistle-blower -- you are not going to besmirch the record of my staff. He got very indignant, wouldn't answer the question.</p><p>LEE SMITH, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: Right. Look, this is a person who has not only injected an enormous conspiracy theory, the most destructive conspiracy theory in U.S. history, but also look at how he has attacked colleagues. He spied on congressional colleagues, including the staff of Congressman Nunes. So this is an extremely destructive figure.</p><p>INGRAHAM: This is what happens when someone actually asks even a slightly probing question of Schiff.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On March 14th, 2014, ""The Washington Post"" had an editorial, the appointment of the vice president's son to Ukrainian oil board looks like nepotism at best, and the said nefarious at worst.</p><p>KATE BEDINGFIELD, BIDEN CAMPAIGN SPOKESWOMAN: This is the equation of Donald Trump's significant impeachable wrongdoing with something not a single person has suggested Joe Biden used to his advantage or his son's advantage.</p><p>It's exactly what Trump wants.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Obviously it's a question about Joe Biden, but same deal. You ask a question they don't want to answer, they call it a conspiracy theory.</p><p>SOLOMON: I'm a pinata in their little conspiracy theory party, they have been beating me around a lot. But the fact of the matter is, if you can't address the facts, you have to use ad hominem attacks to distract, and that is what they've done.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You specifically mentioned something earlier about John Bolton and the Ukrainians. Tell us about this.</p><p>SOLOMON: So this is a fact that you won't hear elsewhere in the media, but a few months before he joined President Trump as a national security adviser, he received $115,000 payment for two speeches to Victor Pinchuk's organization. Victor Pinchuk is a very powerful oligarch in Ukraine and the man who is the single largest donor to the Clinton Foundation. So he is one of the many people that had their finger in that little money jar that is called Ukraine. A lot of politicians have dipped their fingers in that.</p><p>INGRAHAM: A lot of people make a lot of money overseas, Lee, don't they? And there are a lot of people who are working inside the administration who seem very focused on their areas of interest, sometimes not so much on the United States. And Kellyanne Conway was on our show the other night, and she said that she was very worried that people are still inside the administration burrowed and, almost a shallow state, not even a deep state, working against the interests of this president.</p><p>SMITH: This is an enormous problem, and insofar as the National Security Council staff can be winnowed down to an effective instrument to implement the president's policies rather than fighting him on anything, it wouldn't be surprising at all if we find ourselves in the same place but within a matter of months. I imagine that right now the same operators, including Congressman Schiff, including rogue intelligence officers, including, of course, the press, are cooking up something right now as we speak.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Before the election, this is going to --</p><p>SOLOMON: Adam Schiff is Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day,"" the movie. You're going to keep coming back and hearing impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Right, but when we see Fred Fleitz, who was the former chief of staff for John Bolton, he said he believes the NSC should be moved out of the White House. Move the whole thing out of the White House altogether. That is how little he trusts the people at the NSC that are working in the White House right now.</p><p>SOLOMON: It is shameful that we are in a moment in our history where a noble institution like the NSC has to be so distrusted because of their own conduct.</p><p>INGRAHAM: House Intel, it goes on and on.</p><p>SOLOMON: The FBI.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Both of you, thank you so much.</p><p>And coming up, Britain is finally free. A tribute to Brexit. We wanted to be there so bad.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We did it! We transformed the landscape of our country. We are celebrating tonight because we know that this is the single most important moment in the modern history of our great nation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: What a week. We wanted to be there with them. We couldn't because we had to cover impeachment. It was like the Fourth of July in Britain. It was an amazing, amazing event. Brexit is official, or closer to an end. Britain freed itself from its 47-year membership in the E.U. Very satisfying moment. Sorry, Angela Merkel. She remarked, this is a deep cut for us all.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">FOXNWS-2020013101cb257</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5Y3X-49K1-DXH2-61B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2020-02-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""7422""/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=""31"" month=""01"" year=""2020""><dateText>January 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""typeofdoc""><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""company""><classificationItem score=""93""><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""industry""><classificationItem score=""93""><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""93""><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""licensor.indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""licensor.subject""><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrat</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republican</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>impeachment trail</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Adam Schiff</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chuck Schumer</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lev Parnas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John Bolton</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nancy Pelosi</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mitch McConnell</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""legal""><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

But at the corner Wall Boro (Ph) they were more interested in selling and so, they did, largely on a virus that has nothing to do on impeachment. That one looks out of control.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Here comes The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5:00 in Miami, and this is THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Yes, the five is here in Miami for the Super Bowl but first let's get into some breaking news because there's a pivotal moment in President Trump's impeachment trial.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">House managers and Trump's legal team have wrapped up the debate on witnesses and we are awaiting the statement from Senator Mitch McConnell on how things are going to play out from here. So, let's get the latest from Chad Pergram. Chad?</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We are waiting right now for them to come to some sort of agreement to figure out what the lay of the land is going to be like for the rest of the Senate trial. They want to have final arguments from the defense counsel, from the impeachment managers. Maybe speeches from senators and how they bring this end for a landing.</p><p>That's what's going on right now. And there's negotiation going off -- going on off the Senate floor that's right now we are in this weird quorum call, they're not actually trying to take attendance in the Senate. What they're trying to do is negotiate some sort of an agreement offstage.</p><p>Now one rumor that was burning through the capitol earlier this afternoon is that there was an agreement that they would postpone a final vote on the verdicts, with both articles of impeachment until next Wednesday. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader says that's not true. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): We have stood for one thing. We do not want this rushed through. We do not want it in the dark of night. Members have an obligation to tell the American people and to the people of their states why they are voting.</p><p>So, we are not -- we are going to use whatever power we have to present it -- prevent it from being rushed through, but right now there is no agreement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERGRAM: And so, we are waiting to see what might come out tonight that will inform us how long they go tonight, how long they go tomorrow and do they may be postpone a vote until after the State of the Union.</p><p>One thing I've been told this afternoon, that continuing to conduct the Senate trial here of President Trump while they have State of the Union at the Capitol next Tuesday is a logistical nightmare. And so, they might have to take a pause.</p><p>Obviously, there are pressures inside the Democratic caucus to get certain centers running for president to Iowa to campaign. And on the other side of the other disagreement among Republicans on how soon they should wrap this up. You know, senators want to do their due diligence even if it's fait accompli that the president will not be convicted and removed but they want to have their say on the Senate floor.</p><p>And there is concern that if they lead this out until Wednesday or Thursday there is always another bombshell that might erupt somewhere on Capitol Hill. When you have the votes to move something you move quickly.</p><p>And that would not be the case here if something comes in over the trends between now and next Wednesday or Thursday, and that's why some Republican senators are pressuring Mitch McConnell right now to say let's get this over with and perhaps vote this weekend. Dana?</p><p>PERINO: All right, thank you, Chad. We appreciate it. I think everyone would appreciate if it wraps up but it all wrap up when it will wrap up.</p><p>In the meantime, I want to play a couple of things. Listen to this from the Democrats who are saying that the president, even if he is acquitted that they don't think that that would be legitimate if they don't have additional witnesses. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER: If my Republican colleagues refused to consider witnesses and documents in this trial, the president's acquittal will be meaningless, because it will be the result of a sham trial.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): You cannot have a true acquittal if you've not had a fair trial.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): He will not be acquitted. You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lamar's decision it's an offense against the Senate, it's an offense against the rule of law and it's an offense against the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: One of the president's lawyers Patrick Philbin had something different to say about that. He said the impeachment would be actually considered illegitimate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PATRICK PHILBIN, DEPUTY COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT: The House managers have said throughout their presentation and throughout all of the proceedings here again and again that you can't have a trial without witnesses and documents. As if it's just that simple. If you are going to have trial there have to be new witnesses and documents.</p><p>But it's not that simple. There is no need for that because these articles of impeachment on their face are defective.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: All right, Jesse, let's take it around the table. Because we're here for the Super Bowl but we still have impeachment going on, and obviously, I mean, they really like Patrick Philbin.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes. Big cheers for Philbin out here in Miami, guys. Yes. He's the starter around here. Now, I cannot believe the Democrats are trying to impeach the president during Super Bowl weekend. It's just un-American and their timing has been terrible. Again, terrible timing.</p><p>Just permission to make an analogy, Dana.</p><p>PERINO: Are you asking me?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. And it's a sports analogy so just try to follow along.</p><p>PERINO: OK.</p><p>WATTERS: So, on Sunday night, you know, 49ers are going to play the Chiefs.</p><p>PERINO: Got it.</p><p>WATTERS: And at the end of the night, the clock is going to run out, one team is going to go back into the locker room and the other team is going to celebrate victory.</p><p>Why can't Democrats take a page out of that book and lose gracefully? These people have not accepted defeat when Trump won in 2016. They didn't even accept the Mueller report. And now they are saying the Senate trial where he's going to be acquitted that he is not going to be acquitted and it's not a fair trial.</p><p>I mean, this is like flipping a coin, heads, I win, tails, you lose. My 8- year-old daughters have a better grip on reality than that. You can't accuse this guy of cheating every single time he beats you or else you just look like sore losers. And at the end of this whole thing we got to wrap it up, vote on witnesses, vote to acquit and do what Americans do best. In an election year we debate and then we vote.</p><p>PERINO: And also, what about the fact that we have all of this like the illegitimate thing.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Right.</p><p>PERINO: So, it's like every -- it's like word games.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, what they've done is, to use the football analogy, they've moved the goalpost into the parking lot.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: I mean, I don't know where else they can go with this. And Chad, if I may call him Chad, we've never really met -- it really --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: Have you ever hang out with Chad?</p><p>GUTFELD: No, I've never hanged out with Chads.</p><p>WATTERS: With Chads.</p><p>GUTFELD: But it's all about the next bombshell, which are never bombshell's but they're always waiting for the bombshells which turned out to be egg shells which you crush with your hands. You know what drives me crazy, though? How can the meds -- I said the meds -- the media and the Dems always be so outraged when you knew the ending to this?</p><p>We talked about this, we said this is how it was going to end. This is like leaving the theater after seeing the ""Titanic"" and saying, you didn't tell me this ship was going to sink. Now I'm sad. This is all Kabuki theater.</p><p>The media and the Dems think you are stupid and that you're going to fall for this even though you knew it ahead of time. Another film analogy, the Dem, this is political stalking. They are stalking the president. This is political stocking.</p><p>So, they're like the government version of Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction"" and the American people is the bunny.</p><p>PERINO: I'm not good.</p><p>GUTFELD: Because this is a year three-year long obsession which proves that it's an emotional event which you -- is the reason why you see this hyperbole now amongst Morning Joe and all these other nincompoops who are like pulling out what's left of their hair weaves out.</p><p>PERINO: I mean, they don't have your hair.</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't have my -- this is real, Morning Joe!</p><p>PERINO: This is what happened. Juan, there is an old adage in politics that if you're to lose, lose quickly. But the Democrats are wanting to drag this out.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: I don't think they necessarily view it in that way. I mean, you know, you guys are talking sports analogies, I think it's a little bit like Tom Brady deflating the football and then winning. Everyone says, what are you going to do? Or the Houston Astros say, you know what, we're cheating.</p><p>So, you have the U.S. Senate, the U.S&gt; Senate, they are deliberating. Meanwhile, John Kelly, the former chief of staff says, yes, you know what, John Bolton is probably telling the truth and I think that the president was up to something.</p><p>And John Bolton in the New York Times story today --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: He didn't say that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- again, more information from the book. What is Bolton apparently saying? He was in a meeting not only with the president saying put pressure on the Ukrainians, but also putting now the president's lawyer Pat Cipollone in that meeting. You start to think to yourself, yes, there is more coming. Lev Parnas --</p><p>GUTFELD: Bombshells.</p><p>WILLIAMS: These are all -- no, it reminds me specifically of what we heard last night from Lamar Alexander when he announced that he would not vote for witnesses. He said, yes, the Democrats have proved their case, but you know what, yes, it's excessive, it's not good behavior but I'm not going to vote for impeachment. You think, what is going on? Have all institutions in the country just gone to hell?</p><p>GUTFELD: Your bombshells are Hail Mary's.</p><p>WATTERS: Juan, don't you destroy the institutions of this country.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Don't you dare attack the institution.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think Donald Trump is doing a good job.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, when the -- so the senators are the jurors, and when a juror wants to go home on a Friday night and the judge wants to wrap it up, what should -- what do you think Mitch McConnell should do? Try to get this done this weekend?</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think it's everyone -- it's in everyone's best interest to have this concluded before the Super Bowl. Look, I think the issue into touch upon what you're talking about is the institution has been already blasted apart by those guys on the Hill.</p><p>I have never seen such a perversion of due process or procedure in my life. And you know, I go back to what Pelosi said. She called today for the disbarment --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: -- of the White House attorneys. And meanwhile, when she was asked about why bribery was not part of the original articles of impeachment she said, no, no, no, I'm not an attorney.</p><p>And then we had Adam Schiff just now on the floor not a little while ago that said, the Dershowitz -- the Dershowitz defense of unconstitutionality.</p><p>So, we have these people literally attacking the notion that the White House is defending the defendant on trial and they're treating this entire trial, that the jury -- the juror aspect of it as a fact-finding. But that is what is supposed to be what the House did.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO: So, they failed, they apparently need more evidence and more bombshells and more ticking clocks, but at the same time nothing has been uncovered like we've seen from the whole time. Which is why the ending was predictable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, what I was saying was that, John Kelly, the former chief of staff was saying 75 percent of the American people, the constituents of the Senate think that we should have witnesses. And yet, the institution somehow says no, that's not what this is about. It's just about showing loyalty to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Well, you don't --</p><p>PERINO: Right.</p><p>WATTERS: You can't have a witness if there was no crime, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: My gosh.</p><p>PERINO: All right. We're going -- we can keep talking about this but we're also going to talk about the Super Bowl. Because there's a lot more to come on this Senate impeachment trial but you've got to stay with The Five. We have special surprises coming up.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Welcome back to The Five.</p><p>A live look at the Senate floor on this pivotal day of the impeachment trial. We are still awaiting a crucial vote on witnesses. Now if that vote fails it will clear the way for President Trump's acquittal. Here is Adam Schiff earlier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Let the American people know that you understand they deserve the truth. Let them know that you still care about the truth, that the truth still matters. Though much divides us, on this we should agree. A trial stripped of all its trappings should be a search for the truth, and that requires witnesses and testimony. A trial without witnesses is no trial at all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Emily, how would you respond to that plea coming from the lead prosecutor, lead impeachment manager on the Democratic side?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just how hypocritical I find, given that the entire time after this started the House is clamoring for witness testimony at that point. So much so that they had pending court cases about the testimony. And then all of a sudden it didn't matter. And it had to be rushed -- rushed to finish. And then all of a sudden that didn't matter, and instead they sat on it for four weeks.</p><p>And so, it's difficult for me to believe anything out of that man's mouth frankly, but especially when it comes to an actual appreciation of or commitment to actual fact-finding or an actual result that makes sense or transparent process in any way possible because this entire thing has been predictable, political game playing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Jesse, when you hear Adam Schiff say a fair trial and you look at the polls and people say we want witnesses, what do you think?</p><p>WATTERS: I say I don't care what Adam Schiff says. I don't care if he wants a fair trial. It wasn't fair in the House. He doesn't get to play it like that, he's not in charge.</p><p>The Democrats only want their witnesses. They don't want Republican witnesses and that's just not fair. So, to be lectured on fairness from him is ridiculous. And this is why you can't trust Democrats with power. They will abuse it, they will run over the Constitution, they will put up fabricated pieces of evidence, they will lie about it, deceptive articles, bogus subpoenas, and then they'll claim that they knew what the framers wanted.</p><p>I listened to hours and hours and days and days of testimony from probably some of the smartest litigators I've ever heard in my entire life, and they destroyed the Democrats' defense on the facts. They destroyed on the evidence, precedent, the Constitution and the history of this.</p><p>These are weak articles, they never should've been set up, this half-baked cake was poisonous. And then are all of a sudden saying the Senate has to swallow it. The Senate doesn't have to do that. The Senate can do whatever it wants. And what the Senate wants to do is get this over with and get onto the 2020 election.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Dana, the big news today on the Republican side was first, of course, Lamar Alexander, the senator from Tennessee announcing that he would not vote in support of allowing witnesses to testify. And that was followed up, then later today when Lisa Murkowski said she too would not vote to allow witnesses. What's going on, on the Republican side?</p><p>PERINO: Well, it's interesting because it's like the, as I said yesterday the media had all the headlines that the Republicans didn't have enough -- didn't had the votes to block witnesses. It wasn't that the Democrats had to prove their case in order to force witnesses.</p><p>And I think that somebody like Senator Alexander and Murkowski, who two days ago the Democrats were saying, wow, these are really principled people. They are just so amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: So, they came to their conclusion and it's like, wow, what happened to them, they're not -- they must not have their principles or had their heads screwed on straight.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>PERINO: I think that both Murkowski and Alexander were thinking about the institution of the Senate and that going forward it is not a good idea to allow a House process that's not complete, that doesn't go to the third coequal branch, the judiciary to try to solve the dispute before sending over something that is half-baked.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Really? You know, from my perspective I think obstruction is very real. But let me play something for you, Greg. This is Schiff who is saying that John Bolton should be under oath.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHIFF: So here you have the president saying John Bolton is not telling the truth. Let's find out. Let's put John Bolton under oath. Let's find out who is telling the truth. A trial is supposed to be a quest for the truth. Let's not fear what we will learn.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: As I mentioned, the former chief of staff Kelly saying he believes Bolton. What do you say, Greg?</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't matter. You know, Adam Schiff in that first sound on tape said he was condemning division, which is like a pig condemning pork chops. He is 100 percent made of the stuff.</p><p>In the end it requires two-thirds of the Senate vote. Right? To prevent -- why two-thirds? To prevent a partisan impeachment. What this is, is something the Democrats have invented. It's a nuisance impeachment. It's like a nuisance lawsuit except all the Democrats are wearing neck braces and doing slip and falls all at once.</p><p>But the sad thing about nuisance impeachments is that they are easy to do depending on who controls the House. So, both sides can do this and it's going to be a ping-pong thing.</p><p>Remember how we compare -- we are comparing this impeachment to the one in the '90s.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: How soon will we be comparing an impeachment in the future to this one? It could be next year. It could be in two years because a nuisance impeachment will be ongoing. It's like construction outside your house. First day you see it, it's like, what's that doing there? And then you just get used to it.</p><p>WATTERS: Well, actually, I'm excited about impeaching the next Democrat president. I can't wait.</p><p>GUTFELD: What if it's Kanye West?</p><p>WATTERS: Well, we'll let it slide in that case.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wow. Honestly, I'll tell you we're live in Miami and maybe we're hot in Miami. Another live look at the Senate floor in Washington as we await that crucial Senate vote on impeachment trial witnesses. You've got to stay with us because The Five is live from Miami.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back. We continue to monitor the Senate impeachment trial as they approach a critical vote on witnesses. Now the media of course siding with the Democrats and attacking Republicans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE SCARBOROUGH, HOST, MSNBC: Every one of these Republicans are going to be held accountable for them obstructing justice. Obstructing a fair hearing.</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, HOST, CNN: And Russia, if you're listening, 2020 is open for investigation.</p><p>CARL BERNSTEIN, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, CNN: This is a cover up. Plain and simple. We have seen now a really shameful and an episode in our history that is going to wear down for many, many years.</p><p>MICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER: He is saying essentially, let's just say this is a court case. Yes? Yes, he beat his wife. So?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Greg, this just shows me how ineffective the media is. The media and the Democrats, because they work together.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Not able to convince one Republican in the House and most likely not one Republican in the Senate to side against the president.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know, I wrote down five things you probably didn't know about the media but you know now. Number one, it kind of the older echelon, they are getting kind of gross and kind of nonsensical. That leads me to my next step, number two, I think there needs to be term limits for people in the media.</p><p>WATTERS: Except us.</p><p>GUTFELD: Except us. Sorry. Number three, they could -- if they could spend all this time on this baloney, they must not be doing much else, if they can put all their energy into this.</p><p>Number four, they are no longer useful to us, right? There has to be a better way to get your information them from these people like The Five, Fox News, or online. I hear that's a good way to get your news.</p><p>And finally, they all know that it's a game. They know this was a game, they knew how it's going to end, right? So, they are just playing you for a fool thinking you won't know that. Those are my five things. I'll be publishing them later.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. Juan, if you look at what we've seen in the last three years, the media tried to get Hillary elected, failed. Hillary -- they tried to push the Mueller report, no collusion. And now they try to push impeachment. That is about to fail. What does that say about how strong the media actually is in America?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think that what you are talking about is what you perceive to be liberal media.</p><p>WATTERS: I am.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You're not talking about conservative media like gee, the Wall Street Journal, Dredge Report --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: I'm talking about 90 percent --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Hold on. I'm talking about the number one web site in America, Dredge, I'm talking about the number one newspaper, the Wall Street Journal. I could go on.</p><p>But my point to you is when people report something like Alan Dershowitz says, as long as the president thinks it's in the national interest for him to get reelected, then he can do anything.</p><p>GUTFELD: He didn't say that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Or -- yes, he did.</p><p>WATTERS: No, he didn't.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Or Pat Philbin says it's OK for the president to get information from a foreign government to use against a political rival. And you say, media, you're terrible!</p><p>WATTERS: Also not true.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why are you reporting that?</p><p>WATTERS: All right. So, Juan disagrees with the two most prominent constitutional scholars in the country. That's fine.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: You're allowed to disagree.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait.</p><p>WATTERS: I would just kindly disagree with that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What an analogy. This is Tom Brady and the soft football and you are saying, no problem. Go right ahead.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, you are letting --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: You already used that analogy.</p><p>WATTERS: You are letting the air out of this conversation, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes. yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Emily, what do you think about the media's performance in the impeachment seeing?</p><p>COMPAGNO: To me, especially that whole line up, it's one big delusional fabrication. And it reminded me of watching an episode of ""Lost."" Do you remember that show?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Or the ""Matrix."" Where you're screaming at the screen like, how can you even be living like this? This is insane. Or they are to each other and you realize that it's just a bubble of delusion.</p><p>And we have, if we can show it for a second, we have someone who loves to perpetuate that delusion even further, which is Joe Biden talking about that this isn't partisan impeachment. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, CHIEF ANCHOR, ABC NEWS: The partisan impeachment was wrong in 1974, wrong in 1998. Why isn't it wrong now?</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Because it's not a partisan impeachment. He violated the Constitution. Period. Even if it is a party line vote, it just goes -- reflects on those who know in fact in their heart and their head that in fact it's a violation of the Constitution to do what he did, and in fact vote no.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Cocoon delusion.</p><p>WATTERS: Right. So, Dana --</p><p>GUTFELD: Cocoon.</p><p>WATTERS: -- Joe Biden is saying this is not a partisan impeachment. I don't see how he squares that circle.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, that was a -- that's a hard one especially when you -- I think it's -- forget Lamar Alexander and Lisa Murkowski and whether they would vote for witnesses, we knew the president was going to be acquitted.</p><p>The question is really more -- are there more Democrats that are going to vote with the Republicans on acquittal --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: And we think there are a few of them.</p><p>PERINO: If they don't, I'm not going to criticize them.</p><p>WATTERS: I will, Dana. All right, coming up next, the 2020 election heats up. President Trump gets the rock star treatment during his Iowa rally as the Democrats get ready for the caucuses.</p><p>COMPAGNO: President Trump firing up the crowd last night in Des Moines, Iowa as 2020 Democrats make a last-minute push ahead of Monday's first in the nation caucuses. Here's the President last night attacking his rivals.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Let's vote for Pocahontas. Let's vote for Bernie. Let's vote for Sleepy Joe. He's falling to a sleep. Joe -- he always gets the name wrong. How about Buttigieg, Buttigieg? They call him Mayor Pete. You know why? Because nobody can pronounce his name.</p><p>What happened to Mini-Mike Where's he? He's not running. He's skipping four or five states. Mini-Mike, I've had him up to here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: Where did he put his hand?</p><p>COMPAGNO: All right, we have Mitch McConnell speaking on the Senate floor right now. We're going to take you live to that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE: -- under the impeachment rules, any motion to subpoena witnesses or documents, the yeas and nays are required under Senate resolution 483, the clerk will call the roll.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Alexander?</p><p>SEN.

Let's go to Chad Pergram right now.</p><p>PERGRAM: This is where they take a standard roll call vote in the Senate. This was that seminal vote that we were hearing so much about the past couple of days, a gateway vote whether or not they would open the door to call witnesses or not.</p><p>This is a pretty important vote here because, you know, you had Susan Collins from Maine and Mitt Romney from Utah, Republicans announcing last night that they would, you know, vote for witnesses and you had Lamar Alexander, Republican from Tennessee last night saying he would oppose it, and Lisa Murkowski saying this morning that she would oppose it. So we expect this to go down.</p><p>What is unclear after this, the Senate is going to take a recess according to the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, what happens next? It was pretty clear that Mitch McConnell had the votes to block this democratic effort to extend the trial and call witnesses. It's pretty clear that they have the votes down the road to exonerate the President of the United States on both articles of impeachment, but what setup Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lacks right now are votes on how you get from A to C. He lacks the votes on B which is how you finish the trial. Do you have additional debate? How much time do you allocate for the defense counsel and the impeachment managers to present their closing arguments? Emily, that is the key question.</p><p>And right now there is a problem on the Republican side of the aisle. They don't have the votes for that middle step. And that's why a lot of people think this could go deep into the night. They're trying to negotiate some sort of an agreement off stage. There are senators on the Republican side who want to wrap this tonight saying, wait a minute, we have the votes to exonerate the president. Let's vote now. Why stretch this out through State of the Union. This proposal that was floated earlier in the day, maybe vote on Wednesday, the day after the State of the Union.</p><p>But what we know now is that this effort to summon witnesses, that's going to go down. That's what they're voting on right now. And then we will have a recess of an undetermined period in the Senate trial as they try to negotiate what's next offstage. That part is very unclear and very murky at this hour, Emily.</p><p>PERINO: All right, actually, Chad, it's going to be Dana, and I'll take it around the horn here, because what we're basically saying is what we knew was going to happen. I guess we didn't know on the witnesses, Jesse. I mean, that was in question, but we know the ultimate and which is acquittal. So now at this point, if the Democrats know that the Republicans will prevail on no additional witnesses, why not just try to get it done this weekend? I don't understand their political benefit of dragging it out. WATTERS: Well, when you drag it out, there's an opportunity for more bombshells.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: And also, I guess, gives the media an opportunity to continue to shame Senate Republicans who they think are somewhat on the fence. And they want to make sure that Donald Trump delivers his State of the Union address as not acquitted.</p><p>And I just don't see why the Republicans in the Senate, they don't have the votes right now to say let's just wrap it and go. Why don't they just say let's do that get it over with? Why do they have to say oh, well, I want two hours to say something, and then I want another couple of hours to say something?</p><p>We've already heard from all of these managers. We've heard from the President's defense councils. We don't need to hear from 100 senators to say what they want to say.</p><p>PERINO: All right, let's --</p><p>WATTERS: They just put out a statement instead.</p><p>PERINO: Chad Pergram, are you still there with us?</p><p>PERGRAM: Yes, I'm here, Dana. So they've just closed --</p><p>PERINO: OK, what was the final -- what was the final there?</p><p>PERGRAM: Pretty much what we thought, the fait accompli 51-49. The Senate voted to reject the motion on calling witnesses. And because they don't know the roadmap next, this is why the Senate is now in a recess of an undetermined period. They're going to go off stage and try to figure out what's next.</p><p>But 51-49, that was the breakdown. And that's kind of what we thought earlier today once we got the announcement from Lisa Murkowski that she would oppose calling witnesses and the announcements last night from Lamar Alexander, Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, and so on. Everything was set in stone.</p><p>But again, the problem is Mitch McConnell doesn't know how to get to a final vote. That's what the -- in the Senate trial, and that's what these offstage negotiations are going to be about deep into the night tonight, Dana.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Chad, we have one question from Juan and then we're going to get some commentary from Greg and Emily. Go ahead, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So you get two votes from Republicans, Chad, for allowing the witnesses. And now you're telling us that in fact, it's the Republican side led by Mitch McConnell that doesn't have the votes to shut this down. And I think just sitting here, that it must be that Republican -- some Republican senators want the opportunity to speak as to why they are voting the way they are voting when it is seen as so damaging to the institution.</p><p>PERGRAM: Absolutely. You could see where someone like Susan Collins, the Republican from Maine. She is facing a competitive reelection fight this fall in a battleground state. She might want to come out and talk about her position.</p><p>You know, there's a lot of senators even though those who want to extinguish this trial as quickly as possible, who say we are senators, this is an impeachment trial. We have not been given the opportunity to deliberate and speak on the Senate floor. It is our right. I mean, that's the fundamental right of the Senate is unlimited debate.</p><p>And if you're going to neuter, that you fundamentally change the essence of the Senate. And if you've had none of that in a Senate trial, some people might think that that undercuts the quintessence of the Senate, Juan.</p><p>PERINO: All right, we have -- we have Chuck Schumer now live, Chad. Thank you so much. Let's go to Chuck Schumer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): -- where the Senate turned away from truth and went along with a sham trial. This -- if the President is acquitted, with no witnesses, no documents, the acquittal will have no value, because Americans will know that this trial was not a real trial. It had no witnesses, no documents, it's a tragedy on a very large scale.</p><p>I will be now going up to my caucus to discuss what we're doing next. I will not talk about it here, OK. Thanks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: All right, Chad Pergram, if you're still there, basically, Chuck Schumer knew that this is the likely outcome. What now is he going to go up and talk to his caucus about?</p><p>PERGRAM: Well, he's kind of reveling in the fact that Mitch McConnell has this problem. The problem is not with Democrats, the problem is with Republicans. You know, they have the majority. If you have the majority, move. And so that's the issue right now. And so he's going to talk to his caucus about if they come back into session, what things does he put on the table, what proposals.</p><p>You might remember that very lengthy session Tuesday night, last week, going into the wee hours of Wednesday, where they considered multiple proposals from Schumer about how to consider this trial, what witnesses to call, talking about calling John Bolton, talking about calling Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House Chief of Staff, you could have a similar, you know, reprise of that in the next few hours if the Senate were to be in session.</p><p>And this is why McConnell has recessed the Senate so they don't get into that right away. And then you have a lot Senators, some of those vulnerable centers having to take those challenging votes or dragging the Senate down into this quagmire over the next few hours as they fight over this. What they try to do is he's going to go back and say, OK, what are the issues here, what should we be considering?</p><p>You know, there was a proposal from Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip along with Sherrod Brown from Ohio and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, to allow all senators to have a 10-minute wedge of time to talk, you know, put their positions on the record about the trial, again, because senators have not spoken on the Senate floor during this lengthy trial.</p><p>And so, you know, Senators think, you know, they represent X number of people in each state. They should at least be able to express their views on the Senate floor in a debate in only the third presidential impeachment trial in Senate history. Some people regardless of whether you think you should impeach the president knighted states or not say, if you don't do that, then what good is the Senate at all if you can't even debate that on the Senate floor?</p><p>PERINO: Chad, that makes a lot of sense. I can -- I can understand why the senators want to have their say. Thank you so much. Let's go to John Roberts with the latest for us, wherever you are, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: North Lawn of the White House where I'm always staying, Dana.</p><p>PERINO: OK. I couldn't see where you were.</p><p>ROBERTS: I love to be down there with you in Miami where the President is winging its way toward at least most of the way there. He'll be landing in West Palm Beach pretty soon. I'm sure that they were watching the vote on Air Force One a short time ago. Clearly, it was no surprise. They knew that Mick Mulvaney had the votes to turn down witnesses.</p><p>And it's interesting because the President has said all along, hey, look, I'd like to have witnesses. I'd like to hear from John Bolton. I'd like Mick Mulvaney to testify. I'd like to have Mike Pompeo go up there and tell his story, but I also want to hear from people like Hunter Biden, and the whistleblower, and maybe even Joe Biden.</p><p>I mean, it was clear that if they were going to be witnesses, that the republicans and the president, in particular, we're going to push for it. Democrats can't just have their witnesses, the White House and the President are going to want to have his witnesses as well. So I mean, this does alleviate a long protracted battle, because I'm sure that there's no way that Pat Cipollone was going to let John Bolton get up there in front of Congress and testify without going through all of the courts.</p><p>And that could be a lengthy process. That could take place over the course of weeks, if not months. So this is going to alleviate a long drawn out battle. It could go well into the Democratic primary contest. But I think what we're seeing here in the Senate is a no surprise to the White House. I think they're probably pretty happy with the outcome.</p><p>But as Chad Pergram was saying, now, how do you get to the end. The White House is confident that there are not 67 votes to take the president out. There might be a couple of Republican defections, but that only is going to get you to maybe 50, 51 votes maximum. So certainly not the 67. So President Trump is confident that he's not going to be removed from office.</p><p>And you -- and you watch because he tweeted about it again today saying that he believed that the process in the house was completely unfair. The Democrats had all the witnesses they want and a lot of it was being closed doors. Some of the transcripts of those closed-door sessions were not released. His team was not allowed any witnesses in the House proceeding. They didn't even have a chance to present its case until it got to the Senate.</p><p>And that's something that he will definitely focus in on between now and November, and to say that, you know, Republicans are not getting a fair shake out of this process, and then nothing like this should ever happen to another American president. The President will say, Dana, that he's doing this for future presidents, not just himself.</p><p>PERINO: He has said that, John. Thank you. We have news from Chad Pergram about something out of Mitch McConnell's office. Chad?</p><p>PERGRAM: Yes. So Mitch McConnell just put out a statement about that vote that went down rejecting witnesses. He said, look, we've been through all of these documents, we've heard all these arguments. We don't think that we need to have witnesses. But I'm going to refer to the final paragraph of this statement here from Mitch McConnell here, and I'm just reading this off my phone because things are happening in real-time here on Capitol Hill.</p><p>""Senators will now confer among ourselves with the House managers and with the President's Council to determine the next steps as we prepare to conclude the trial in the coming days, in the coming days."" This is the first time definitively we've heard something from someone in leadership. You know, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicating that this is not going to wrap up eminently.</p><p>I was told earlier in the day that they thought that there was no chance that they would finish this tonight. So the coming days is the key question. Now, again, you know, a couple of hours ago on another program, I was asked whether or not they would consider postponing State of the Union. There's a bit of a logistical issue here for Tuesday. I spoke to one congressional security source who told me that there had been no consideration of that whatsoever, but would not rule it out.</p><p>You know, here's the other thing, that so much of what we see in politics is very scripted. It's very, you know, kind of wrote and we expect A then B, then C. What we're seeing here at the Capitol tonight is unfolding in real-time. We really don't know how this is going to turn out. We know that probably in a day or two, that they will exonerate the President of the United States on the articles of impeachment. But what happens in the interim? What happens tonight? What happens over the weekend? Who gets to speak?</p><p>You know, that interim, you know, kind of process is very up in the air and Mitch McConnell nor Chuck Schumer nor any of us can interpret exactly what's going to happen because nobody really knows. Why? It will come down to the votes. They have to figure out some sort of agreement, 51 votes that can pass the Senate to set the remaining framework for this trial and get to final verdict for the President, as Mitch McConnell says, ""in the coming days.""</p><p>PERINO: All right, all right, close quote. Thank you, Chad Pergram. And we're going to take it around the table here on the remaining time that we have. You have some thoughts there, Greg?</p><p>GUTFELD: Thank God he kept that short. Wow. Look, I said the same thing over and over again, because we knew what was going to happen. The story never changes. It's like when you're dealing with a drug addict, who says no, no, I change I swear, I change. No, this story has been the same. We knew how the vote was going to go. We know how it's going to go next week or the week after that because we know the kernel. The nugget of this story is that it was initiated three years ago, right?</p><p>This quixotic adventure is not about a phone call. It was about the day Hillary lost. So we all know that. What we're being forced to participate in is the Democrats version of revenge porn. And that's why it is so exhausting to be sitting here and listening every day to this and then have to feel bad for the viewers who had to sit through this crap.</p><p>PERINO: Well --</p><p>WATTERS: It's funny that you mentioned that because Adam Schiff actually tried to get naked pictures of Donald Trump.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: So well said, Greg. I'm not going to spike the football, Juan, because I don't want to do that. I'm not a Showboat. Democrats just suffered an enormous tactical loss right then on the floor of the Senate. We know how it ends from now. This is a strategic retreat by the Democrats. They're still trying to empty their clips, but it's pretty much done.</p><p>McConnell has guided this thing through the system very well, very methodically, very maturely, a little bit of a speed bump here, but I'm sure he's kind of -- kind of bring the boat to home. Now, this now looks more than ever, like this whole impeachment thing was a move to protect Joe Biden. Trump had zeroed in on his family's corruption. They tried to knock him out at the knees. It went all the way up to the Senate trial, and then we get an acquittal.</p><p>And you have to look at yourself and think this thing backfired, because now everybody's talking about where is Hunter. Everybody understands Joe quid pro Joe is his new nickname, not sleepy anymore. His crowd size is microscopic at this point, and Bernie Sanders is surging in Iowa. So it did not go as planned.</p><p>And my only thing now is what do the Democrats do next? You know, they boycotted the inauguration, they teed up a special counsel investigation, they tried to impeach the president, he gets acquitted. What are they going to do in the second term? I mean, they handled the first loss so terribly. What happens with a landslide? I'm scared, Juan, hold me.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'll hold you. I'll hold you.</p><p>WATTERS: I know it's going to be dangerous.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I know. I know. My darling, you are so, so evil. I know because I can see that on the Republican side right now, Mitch McConnell scorched earth strategy to protect the president that clearly it's no longer the GOP, it's the party of Trump, and they are protecting Trump at all --no holds barred.</p><p>Let's just protect Donald Trump. They couldn't get to Republicans right now to say shut down a fair trial, no witnesses, so that's why the two broke away. They could -- but remember, the American people and Democrats couldn't get four to simply say, let's have a fair trial, let's have some witness.</p><p>WATTERS: They're going to get three Senate Democrats to vote to acquit.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Hang on. Hang on. So what you get right now is Republicans, Republican senators, starting to ask questions about how they come out of this even in the party of Trump. What will they look like with a ticket led by Donald Trump where they have to defend the fact that they allowed the Senate, the institution to suffer such damage, that they allowed the American people to be diluted that John Bolton is off the charts. Everybody around, Donald Trump goes down. And they say, oh, we got to protect Donald Trump.</p><p>PERINO: It's really interesting because you have these -- Emily, people have such strong feelings on both sides. And if you look at the polling from the beginning of this to now, nothing has changed except the president's approval ratings ticked up a point or two.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Right, because while this is all going on, he's actually earning the paycheck that he donates whereas everyone else on the Hill, they are not earning the paychecks that we pay and that our tax dollars pay. I think we're so far beyond strategy at this point. We're so far beyond tactics. It's just ego.</p><p>The ego of -- the ego of Schumer, especially in those comments right there, where he's basically saying that he has zero faith in his fellow senators. It was their prerogative and their assessment during that vote to determine whether they needed additional evidence to vote and to move on those articles of impeachment.</p><p>The votes said enough. So why all of a sudden when it suits them versus the political process, and then all of a sudden, oh, no, it's a trial that we see mirrored in actual courts, and therefore witnesses are a must. But there was zero discussion of evidence. I think the GOP has extended a generous amount of patience, but it's not infinite.</p><p>And so to your point about just around the corner, and just around the corner, and what about this, at one point, is it going to end? The statement we just saw right there in the vote, it ends now.</p><p>PERINO: Well, the State of the Union, I don't think they're going to -- they'll figure out a way. They shouldn't delay the State of the Union. Everybody wants the president to be -- oh, I shouldn't say everybody.</p><p>GUTFELD: I'm making my State of the Union (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>PERINO: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. If I -- if I can't have my (INAUDIBLE) on the State of the Union, I don't know what I'm going to do. You know what the story is about, Dana. I'm going to do like a -- like a lifetime thing. It's about the power of the House, the power of the President, but most important, the power of the media to shape a narrative to suit their needs. That's what this is about.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know what this is like? I remember after Mueller, the President said he had been totally exonerated. Of course, Mueller said no such thing to the point.</p><p>GUTFELD: How did that Mueller think work out for you, Juan?</p><p>WILIAMS: But you know what -- no, what I'm saying is the president comes out and he just talked about setting the way America --</p><p>GUTFELD: But Mueller was a disaster for your side.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's the guy with the bully pulpit and you can be sure that's what Trump is going to say even though that's not the case.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, but Mueller was a disaster for your side.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: He was not -- he was not in good shape.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, I see. Because he didn't indict the president.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, it was a mess, Juan. It was a mess. He was embarrassing.</p><p>WATTERS: He spent two years investigating a hoax and then couldn't defend his own work during a hearing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>WATTERS: Now you keep saying that Trump is destroying all these institutions. I would argue that the left is destroying themselves. If you look at the FBI. The FBI agents Peter Strzok, James Comey, they destroyed that institution.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, yes.</p><p>WATTERS: The media, they have destroyed themselves because no one believes the thing they say anymore because they lie. The Supreme Court after Kavanaugh, you say that now institution has been compromised. No, that was another lie by people like Dianne Feinstein and Michael Avenatti. And finally, now that the Senate has constitutionally on the verge of quitting the president, you're saying now the Senate as an institution been destroyed.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, let me just say -- all right, let me just say this.</p><p>WATTERS: All of that is not true.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Let me just say this.</p><p>WATTERS: And I think you owe all of those institutions an apology.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, because they're being damaged and I hate to see it because I love America. And I'm going to tell you something. The division is evident in the fact that as we sit here today, Dana was talking about the numbers haven't moved. The numbers haven't moved from this. About half -- it is. Half the American people think this guy should be out of office. How is that healing?</p><p>PERINO: Well, they'll have the opportunity to vote.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know what will heal people? You know what will heal people? Do you know that tomorrow night, Jesse has a live show at 8:00? Emily is on the ""GREG GUTFELD SHOW"" tomorrow night.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm going to watch. I'm going to watch. I'm here. I'm putting down the liquor.</p><p>GUTFELD: I have to put in a plug. That's right. That's right.</p><p>PERINO: That's a very good plug.</p><p>GUTFELD: Also, we're on -- we're on a 5:00.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Sunday.</p><p>PERINO: Sunday.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Sunday.</p><p>GUTFELD: 5:00, baby.</p><p>PERINO: And also, Juan and I will be here from 12:00 to 2:00 Sunday. There's so many plugs it's like Greg's hair.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier
